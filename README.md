## What is Reel?

Reel is a native Linux media player that brings your Plex and Jellyfin libraries to the GNOME desktop. Written entirely in Rust, it leverages the language's performance and memory safety to deliver a fast, reliable media experience without the overhead of web technologies.

## ‚ú® Key Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **ü¶Ä Pure Rust** | Fast, memory-safe, and concurrent by design |
| **üîå Multi-Backend** | Supports Plex and Jellyfin, with local files planned |
| **üíæ Offline-First** | SQLite caching keeps your library browsable even offline |
| **üé® Native GTK4** | Seamlessly integrates with modern GNOME desktops |
| **‚ö° Async Everything** | Built on Tokio for responsive, non-blocking operations |
| **üé• Dual Players** | MPV (default) and GStreamer backends for maximum compatibility |

## üöÄ Getting Started

This project uses Nix flakes to manage the development environment, ensuring all dependencies (including GStreamer plugins and GTK schemas) are properly configured.

### üìã Prerequisites

- Nix with flakes enabled
- Git

### üî® Building with Nix

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/arsfeld/gnome-reel.git
cd gnome-reel

# Enter the Nix development shell
nix develop

# Build the Rust project
cargo build

# Run the application
cargo run
```

### üíª Development Commands

Inside the Nix shell:

```bash
# Format Rust code
cargo fmt

# Run Clippy lints
cargo clippy

# Run test suite
cargo test

# Build optimized release binary
cargo build --release
```

## üì¶ Installation

### üì• Download Pre-built Packages

Download the latest release from the [Releases page](https://github.com/arsfeld/gnome-reel/releases/latest).

> [!WARNING]
> **Pre-built packages are experimental**: These packages are automatically generated and may not be thoroughly tested. If you encounter issues, consider building from source using the Nix development environment.

#### AppImage (Universal - Recommended)
```bash
# Download the AppImage
wget https://github.com/arsfeld/gnome-reel/releases/latest/download/reel-v0.3.0-x86_64.AppImage
chmod +x reel-*.AppImage
./reel-*.AppImage
```

#### Debian/Ubuntu (.deb)
```bash
# Download and install the .deb package
wget https://github.com/arsfeld/gnome-reel/releases/latest/download/reel-v0.3.0-amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i reel-*.deb
sudo apt-get install -f  # Install dependencies if needed
```

#### Fedora/RHEL/openSUSE (.rpm)
```bash
# Download and install the .rpm package
wget https://github.com/arsfeld/gnome-reel/releases/latest/download/reel-v0.3.0-x86_64.rpm
sudo dnf install ./reel-*.rpm
# or for older systems:
sudo rpm -i reel-*.rpm
```

### ‚ùÑÔ∏è Nix/NixOS

```bash
# Run directly with Nix flakes
nix run github:arsfeld/gnome-reel
```

### üì¶ Flatpak

> [!NOTE]
> üöß **Coming Soon** - Flatpak packaging is planned to make Reel available across all Linux distributions.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

<details>
<summary><b>Click to see architecture diagram</b></summary>

Reel follows Rust best practices with a clean separation of concerns:

```
UI Layer (GTK4/Blueprint templates)
    ‚Üì
Application State (Arc<RwLock> shared state)
    ‚Üì
Service Layer (Tokio async services)
    ‚Üì
Backend Trait (Generic MediaBackend interface)
    ‚Üì
Implementations (Plex, Jellyfin, Local)
```

</details>

The entire codebase leverages Rust's type system and ownership model to prevent common bugs at compile time, while async/await enables efficient handling of network requests and media operations.
