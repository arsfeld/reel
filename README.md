## What is Reel?

Reel is a native, cross-platform media player that brings your Plex and Jellyfin libraries to the desktop with a premium, Netflix-like experience. Written entirely in Rust, it leverages the language's performance and memory safety to deliver a fast, reliable media experience without the overhead of web technologies. Currently focused on Linux/GNOME with GTK4, Reel is architected for multi-platform support with macOS development underway using both Swift-bridge and Cocoa (objc2) approaches.

## üöÄ Getting Started

This project uses Nix flakes to manage the development environment, ensuring all dependencies (including GStreamer plugins and GTK schemas) are properly configured.

### üìã Prerequisites

- Git

### üî® Building with Nix

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/arsfeld/gnome-reel.git
cd gnome-reel

# Enter the Nix development shell
nix develop

# Build the Rust project
cargo build

# Run the application
cargo run
```

### üíª Development Commands

Inside the Nix shell:

```bash
# Format Rust code

## üì¶ Installation

### üì• Download Pre-built Packages

Download the latest release from the [Releases page](https://github.com/arsfeld/gnome-reel/releases/latest).

> [!WARNING]
> **Pre-built packages are experimental**: These packages are automatically generated and may not be thoroughly tested. If you encounter issues, consider building from source using the Nix development environment.

#### AppImage (Universal - Recommended)
```bash
# Download the AppImage
wget https://github.com/arsfeld/gnome-reel/releases/latest/download/reel-v0.3.0-x86_64.AppImage

```

#### Debian/Ubuntu (.deb)
```bash
# Download and install the .deb package
wget https://github.com/arsfeld/gnome-reel/releases/latest/download/reel-v0.3.0-amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i reel-*.deb
sudo apt-get install -f  # Install dependencies if needed
```

#### Fedora/RHEL/openSUSE (.rpm)
```bash
# Download and install the .rpm package
wget https://github.com/arsfeld/gnome-reel/releases/latest/download/reel-v0.3.0-x86_64.rpm
sudo dnf install ./reel-*.rpm
# or for older systems:
sudo rpm -i reel-*.rpm
```

### ‚ùÑÔ∏è Nix/NixOS

```bash
# Run directly with Nix flakes
nix run github:arsfeld/gnome-reel
```

### üì¶ Flatpak

> [!NOTE]
> üöß **Coming Soon** - Flatpak packaging is planned to make Reel available across all Linux distributions.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

<details>
<summary><b>Click to see architecture diagram</b></summary>

Reel implements a modern reactive architecture with clean separation of concerns:

```
UI Layer (GTK4/libadwaita with Blueprint templates)
    ‚Üì
ViewModels (Reactive properties with change notifications)
    ‚Üì
Event System (Tokio broadcast-based event bus)
    ‚Üì
Service Layer (DataService, SyncManager, SourceCoordinator)
    ‚Üì
Repository Pattern (Type-safe SeaORM repositories)
    ‚Üì
Database Layer (SQLite with migrations and caching)
    ‚Üì
Backend Trait (Generic MediaBackend interface)
    ‚Üì
Implementations (Plex, Jellyfin, Local Files)
```

**Key Architectural Patterns:**
- **Reactive ViewModels**: Observable properties that automatically update UI
- **Event-Driven Updates**: System-wide event broadcasting for data changes
- **Repository Pattern**: Clean data access layer with SeaORM
- **Three-Tier Caching**: Memory (LRU) ‚Üí Database (SQLite) ‚Üí Backend API
- **Platform Abstraction**: Frontend trait enables multi-platform support

</details>

The entire codebase leverages Rust's type system and ownership model to prevent common bugs at compile time, while async/await with Tokio enables efficient handling of network requests and media operations. The application is currently 75% through a migration to a fully reactive architecture.
