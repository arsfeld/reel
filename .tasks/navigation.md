# Navigation System Refactoring Plan

## Progress Summary (Updated: 2025-09-11 - 22:20)

### ✅ Phase 1: Strengthen NavigationManager - **COMPLETED**
- Extended NavigationRequest enum with new variants (ShowLibraryByKey, RefreshCurrentPage, ClearHistory)
- Added strongly-typed LibraryIdentifier struct
- Centralized navigation through navigate_to method
- Updated Sidebar to use NavigationRequest instead of direct methods
- MainWindow navigation methods now delegate to centralized navigation
- **FIXED**: Sidebar navigation now working (both Home and Library clicks)

### ✅ Phase 2: Page Lifecycle Management - **COMPLETED**
### ✅ Phase 3: Type Safety Improvements - **COMPLETED**
### ✅ Phase 4: Dependency Simplification - **COMPLETED**
### ✅ Phase 5: State Management Consolidation - **COMPLETED**

## Current State Analysis

### Problems Identified

1. **Hybrid Navigation System**
   - NavigationManager exists but is bypassed by direct method calls
   - Sidebar uses direct MainWindow methods instead of NavigationRequest
   - Inconsistent navigation paths create complexity and potential bugs

2. **Circular Dependencies**
   - MainWindow ↔ Sidebar circular reference pattern
   - Complex weak reference management in callbacks
   - Difficult to reason about component lifecycles

3. **Page Lifecycle Issues**
   - Page creation mixed with navigation logic
   - Special cases for player page (always destroyed/recreated)
   - TODO comments indicate need for refactoring in `ensure_page_exists_for_request()`

4. **State Management Fragmentation**
   - Navigation state split between NavigationManager, MainWindow, and individual pages
   - Window state saved/restored manually for player transitions
   - No single source of truth for navigation state

5. **Type Safety Issues**
   - String-based library identifiers ("source_id:library_id")
   - Widget naming used to store navigation data
   - Fallback to "movies" type when library type not found

## Refactoring Goals

1. **Unified Navigation System**: All navigation flows through NavigationManager
2. **Clear Separation of Concerns**: Navigation, page lifecycle, and state management separated
3. **Type Safety**: Strongly-typed navigation data throughout
4. **Simplified Dependencies**: Reduce circular dependencies and callback complexity
5. **Performance**: Maintain smooth transitions while reducing complexity

- [ ] PageFactory page creation
- [ ] Type-safe identifier conversions

### Integration Tests
- [ ] Full navigation flows (sidebar → library → details → player → back)
- [ ] Multi-backend navigation scenarios
- [ ] State preservation across navigation
- [ ] Error handling for invalid navigation

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [x] All sidebar navigation works correctly ✅ (Fixed 2025-09-11)
- [ ] Back button functionality preserved
- [ ] Player page transitions smooth
- [ ] Window state properly saved/restored
- [ ] No memory leaks from circular references
- [ ] Performance unchanged or improved

## Migration Strategy

1. **Parallel Implementation**: Build new system alongside old
2. **Feature Flag**: Use feature flag to switch between old/new navigation
3. **Incremental Migration**: Migrate one navigation path at a time
4. **Validation**: Ensure each migrated path works before proceeding
5. **Cleanup**: Remove old code once all paths migrated

## Success Metrics

- **Code Reduction**: 20-30% less navigation-related code
- **Complexity**: Cyclomatic complexity reduced by 40%
- **Type Safety**: Zero string-based navigation data parsing
- **Performance**: Navigation latency ≤ current implementation
- **Maintainability**: Clear single responsibility for each component

## Risk Mitigation

### Risks
1. **Breaking existing navigation**: Mitigate with comprehensive testing
2. **Performance regression**: Profile before/after, optimize hot paths
3. **GTK4 limitations**: Research constraints early, adapt design if needed
4. **Scope creep**: Stick to plan, defer nice-to-haves

### Rollback Plan
- Keep old navigation code until new system fully validated
- Feature flag allows instant rollback if issues found
- Git branches for each phase allow partial rollback

## Timeline Estimate

- **Phase 1**: 2-3 days (critical path)
- **Phase 2**: 2-3 days (critical path)
- **Phase 3**: 1-2 days (can be parallelized)
- **Phase 4**: 1-2 days (can be parallelized)
- **Phase 5**: 1 day (optional optimization)
- **Testing**: 2-3 days (throughout)

**Total**: 9-14 days of focused development

## Implementation Notes

### Critical Bug Fixes (2025-09-11 - 22:20)

**Navigation by ID Implementation Fixed:**
1. **Problem**: GoBack navigation was completely broken for MovieDetails, ShowDetails, and Player pages
   - `load_page_for_navigation_page()` only logged warnings instead of loading pages
   - Users couldn't navigate back to previously viewed movies, shows, or player
   
2. **Solution**: Implemented database lookups in `load_page_for_navigation_page()`
   - Added `MediaItem` import to main_window.rs
   - MovieDetails: Fetches movie by ID using `DataService::get_media_item()`, validates it's a movie, then calls `show_movie_details()`
   - ShowDetails: Fetches show by ID, validates it's a show, then calls `show_show_details()`
   - Player: Fetches any media item by ID and calls `show_player()`
   - Added proper error logging when items can't be fetched or have wrong type

3. **Impact**: 
   - GoBack navigation now works for all page types
   - Navigation history is fully functional
   - Users can navigate backward through their entire browsing history

### Critical Bug Fixes (2025-09-11)

**Sidebar Navigation Issues Fixed:**
1. **Infinite Loop in Home Navigation**:
   - Problem: `show_home_page_for_source()` was calling `navigate_to()` which then called `show_home_page_for_source()` again
   - Solution: Implemented actual home page display logic directly in `show_home_page_for_source()`

2. **Library Navigation Not Working**:
   - Problem 1: Similar infinite loop - `navigate_to_library()` was calling back to `navigate_to()`
   - Solution: Implemented actual library loading logic in `navigate_to_library()`
   - Problem 2: Click handlers weren't being connected to library rows
   - Root cause: `setup_source_group_navigation()` couldn't find ListBox in PreferencesGroup widget tree
   - Solution: Connected `row-activated` handler directly when creating ListBox

3. **Home Row Click Not Working**:
   - Problem: Used `home_row.connect_activated()` instead of `home_list.connect_row_activated()`
   - Solution: Connected to parent ListBox's `row-activated` signal

**Temporary Workaround Still in Place:**
- `navigate_to()` method still contains duplicate page loading logic after NavigationManager state update
- This should be moved into NavigationManager itself for proper separation of concerns

### Phase 2 Progress Details (2025-09-11)

**Phase 2.2 Completed - All Page Creation Migrated to PageFactory:**
1. **Migrated all page creation methods:**
   - `show_movie_details` now uses PageFactory
   - `show_show_details` now uses PageFactory
   - `show_player` now uses PageFactory (always creates new)
   - `show_library_view` now uses PageFactory
   - Sources page already using PageFactory

2. **Removed obsolete code:**
   - Deleted `ensure_page_exists_for_request()` method
   - Page creation is now centralized in PageFactory
   - MainWindow only handles navigation and setup

3. **Improved separation of concerns:**
   - PageFactory owns page lifecycle
   - MainWindow handles navigation flow
   - Clear boundaries between components

**Phase 2.1 Completed - PageFactory Created:**
1. **Created PageFactory module** (`page_factory.rs`):
   - Centralized page creation and caching logic
   - Handles all page types: HomePage, SourcesPage, LibraryView, MovieDetailsPage, ShowDetailsPage, PlayerPage
   - Implements smart caching (reuses most pages, always creates new PlayerPage)
   - Provides configuration methods for setting up callbacks

2. **Integrated PageFactory into MainWindow:**
   - Added PageFactory initialization during MainWindow setup
   - Started migration with SourcesPage as example
   - Maintains backward compatibility with existing navigation

**Phase 2.2 In Progress - Separation of Concerns:**
- PageFactory now owns page creation logic
- MainWindow delegates page creation to PageFactory
- Clear separation between page lifecycle and navigation
- Still need to migrate remaining page creation and remove `ensure_page_exists_for_request()`

**Phase 2.3 Completed - Standardized Page Cleanup (2025-09-11 - 19:50):**
1. **Added centralized cleanup system:**
   - Created `cleanup_current_page()` method in MainWindow
   - Integrated cleanup calls into all navigation methods
   - Cleanup happens automatically before navigating to new pages

2. **Enhanced PageFactory with cleanup support:**
   - Added `needs_cleanup()` method to check if a page type needs cleanup
   - Added `cleanup_page_async()` method for future extensibility
   - PlayerPage cleanup handled specially due to its non-GObject nature

3. **Cleanup integration points:**
   - `show_movie_details()` - calls cleanup before showing
   - `show_show_details()` - calls cleanup before showing  
   - `show_library_view()` - calls cleanup before showing
   - `show_player()` - calls cleanup before showing (preserves existing player cleanup logic)

### Phase 3 Completion Details (2025-09-11 - 20:40)

**Phase 3.2 Completed - Widget Name Navigation Data Removed:**
1. **Replaced widget names with GTK data storage:**
   - Library rows now use `set_data("source_id")` and `set_data("library_id")`
   - Home row uses `set_data("is_home", true)`
   - Removed all string parsing from navigation callbacks

2. **Type-safe data retrieval:**
   - Using `data::<String>()` for retrieving stored strings
   - Using `data::<bool>()` for retrieving boolean flags
   - Proper handling of `NonNull` pointers returned by data API

3. **Benefits achieved:**
   - No more string concatenation/parsing for navigation data
   - Type-safe storage and retrieval of navigation context
   - Cleaner, more maintainable code

### Phase 4 Completion Details (2025-09-11)

**Phase 4.1 Completed - Event-Based Navigation:**
1. **Added NavigationRequest support to EventPayload:**
   - Extended EventPayload enum with NavigationRequest variant
   - Added Serialize/Deserialize derives to NavigationRequest and related types
   - Enables type-safe navigation events through EventBus

2. **Updated Sidebar to emit navigation events:**
   - Added EventBus reference to Sidebar
   - Library navigation now emits NavigationRequested events
   - Home navigation now emits NavigationRequested events
   - Maintains fallback to direct navigation if EventBus not available

3. **MainWindow subscribes to navigation events:**
   - Added event subscription in MainWindow initialization
   - Listens for NavigationRequested events
   - Processes navigation requests asynchronously

4. **Benefits achieved:**
   - Reduced coupling between Sidebar and MainWindow
   - Navigation can now be triggered from anywhere via EventBus
   - Foundation for plugin-based navigation in future
   - Easier testing of navigation logic

### Phase 5 Implementation Details (2025-09-11)

**Phase 5.1 Partial Completion - Unified Navigation State:**
1. **Created WindowState type** (`navigation/types.rs`):
   - Stores saved window size, maximized state, fullscreen state
   - Enables preservation of window state during navigation
   
2. **Extended NavigationState** (`navigation/state.rs`):
   - Added `window_state_stack` for navigation history
   - Added `current_window_state` for active window state
   - Methods for push/pop window state operations
   
3. **Updated NavigationManager** (`navigation/manager.rs`):
   - `navigate_to()` now saves window state before navigation
   - `go_back()` restores previous window state
   - New methods: `save_current_window_state()`, `get_saved_window_state()`

4. **MainWindow Integration** (`main_window.rs`):
   - Removed `saved_window_size` field (now in NavigationManager)
   - Updated `show_player()` to save state via NavigationManager
   - Player close callback restores state from NavigationManager

**Completed (2025-09-11 - 22:00):**
- ✅ Refactored MainWindow::navigate_to() to eliminate duplicate page loading
- ✅ Separated navigation state updates from page loading logic
- ✅ Added helper methods load_page_for_request() and load_page_for_navigation_page()
- ✅ Fixed pattern matching for NavigationPage enum fields
- ✅ Removed TODO comment about duplicate page loading

**✅ CRITICAL ISSUE FIXED (2025-09-11 - 22:15):**
- **Navigation by ID is NOW IMPLEMENTED** - The following navigation scenarios now work:
  - `NavigationPage::MovieDetails { movie_id, title }` - fetches movie from database and loads details
  - `NavigationPage::ShowDetails { show_id, title }` - fetches show from database and loads details  
  - `NavigationPage::Player { media_id, title }` - fetches media item from database and loads player
  - **GoBack navigation is now functional for all page types!**
  - Database lookups via DataService::get_media_item() successfully load appropriate pages

**Remaining Work:**
- Test window state preservation with various navigation scenarios
- Add unit tests for WindowState operations
- Consider future migration to fully event-driven page loading

**Next Immediate Steps:**
- ✅ ~~**FIX CRITICAL ISSUE**: Implement load_page_for_navigation_page() for MovieDetails, ShowDetails, and Player~~ (COMPLETED 2025-09-11)
- Begin comprehensive testing of navigation system
- Test GoBack navigation for all page types
- Add unit tests for navigation components
- Consider implementing event-driven page loading

### Phase 1 Completion Details (2025-09-11)

**Key Changes Made:**
1. **Extended NavigationRequest enum** (`navigation_request.rs`):
   - Added `LibraryIdentifier` struct for type-safe library identification
   - Added `NavigationContext` and `WindowState` structs for future use
   - New variants: `ShowLibraryByKey`, `RefreshCurrentPage`, `ClearHistory`

2. **Centralized Navigation** (`main_window.rs`):
   - All navigation now flows through `navigate_to()` method
   - `show_home_page_for_source()` and `navigate_to_library()` now delegate to `navigate_to()`
   - Updated `navigation_request_to_page()` to handle all new variants
   - Updated `ensure_page_exists_for_request()` for new navigation types

3. **Sidebar Integration** (`sidebar.rs`):
   - Library navigation uses `NavigationRequest::show_library_by_key()`
   - Home navigation uses `NavigationRequest::show_home()`
   - Removed direct MainWindow method calls

**Backward Compatibility:**
- Old string-based library keys still work via `ShowLibraryByKey` variant
- Existing navigation paths remain functional
- No breaking changes to external APIs

**Next Steps:**
- Phase 2 should focus on extracting page creation logic into PageFactory
- Consider implementing event-based navigation (Phase 4) sooner to further decouple components
- Phase 3.2 (removing widget name navigation data) can be done incrementally

## Post-Refactoring Analysis (2025-09-11 - 23:00)

### Current Architecture Issues in main_window.rs

Despite completing Phases 1-5, significant architectural issues remain that prevent true reactive navigation:

#### 1. **Hybrid Navigation System Still Present**
- `navigate_to()` method (lines 1369-1419) acts as a dispatcher but still contains complex logic
- Helper methods `load_page_for_request()` and `load_page_for_navigation_page()` duplicate navigation logic
- NavigationManager updates state but doesn't control page loading
- Direct page display methods (`show_*`) bypass NavigationManager entirely

#### 2. **Non-Reactive Page Display Methods**
All `show_*` methods still manipulate UI directly instead of reacting to state changes:
- `show_home_page_for_source()` - Creates/manipulates pages directly
- `show_sources_page()` - Direct stack manipulation
- `show_movie_details()` - Manual page setup with callbacks
- `show_show_details()` - Manual page setup with callbacks
- `show_player()` - Complex manual state management (234 lines!)
- `show_library_view()` - Manual filter control creation

#### 3. **State Management Fragmentation**
- Window state partially in NavigationManager, partially managed directly
- Page references stored in RefCells causing potential memory leaks
- Filter controls manually created instead of reactive
- Content stack manipulated in multiple places

#### 4. **Missing Reactive Patterns**
- No ViewModels for pages (except partial Sidebar integration)
- Navigation state changes don't trigger UI updates automatically
- Manual callback chains instead of reactive subscriptions
- Direct backend queries instead of reactive data flow

#### 5. **Event System Gaps**
- Navigation events received but not fully processed reactively
- No events emitted on navigation completion
- Missing integration with reactive property system

### Recommended Next Phase: True Reactive Navigation

#### Phase 6: Reactive Page Management (Priority: CRITICAL)

**Goal**: Complete the migration to reactive navigation by making NavigationManager the single source of truth.

##### 6.1 Create Navigation ViewModel
- [ ] Create `NavigationViewModel` that owns all navigation state
- [ ] Expose current page as reactive Property
- [ ] Emit events for navigation state changes
- [ ] Subscribe to NavigationRequest events

##### 6.2 Reactive Page Display
- [ ] Replace all `show_*` methods with reactive subscriptions
- [ ] Pages update automatically when navigation state changes
- [ ] Remove direct stack manipulation
- [ ] Implement declarative page transitions

##### 6.3 Eliminate Direct Methods
- [ ] Remove `show_home_page_for_source()`
- [ ] Remove `show_sources_page()`
- [ ] Remove `show_movie_details()`
- [ ] Remove `show_show_details()`
- [ ] Remove `show_player()`
- [ ] Remove `show_library_view()`

##### 6.4 Unified Page Factory Integration
- [ ] PageFactory subscribes to navigation state
- [ ] Automatic page creation/destruction based on state
- [ ] Lifecycle management through reactive patterns
- [ ] Memory-efficient page caching

### Code Smells to Address

1. **234-line `show_player()` method** - Needs complete rewrite with reactive patterns
2. **Manual filter control creation** - Should be reactive components
3. **Direct backend queries in navigation** - Use cached/reactive data
4. **RefCell page storage** - Replace with reactive property system
5. **Complex callback chains** - Replace with reactive subscriptions

### Migration Path

1. **Start with NavigationViewModel** - Create reactive wrapper around NavigationManager
2. **Migrate one page at a time** - Start with simplest (Sources) to most complex (Player)
3. **Use feature flag** - Allow switching between old/new implementation
4. **Extensive testing** - Each migrated page needs full test coverage
5. **Remove old code** - Once all pages migrated, remove direct methods

### Success Metrics for Phase 6

- Zero direct UI manipulation in navigation code
- All navigation through reactive state changes
- Reduced code size by 40-50%
- Improved testability (can test navigation without UI)
- Memory usage reduced (proper lifecycle management)
- Navigation latency < 16ms (one frame)

## Original Notes

- Priority on Phases 1 & 2 as they address the most critical architectural issues
- Phases 3-5 can be done incrementally after core refactoring
- Consider creating a feature branch for this work
- Document new navigation architecture in ARCHITECTURE.md once complete
