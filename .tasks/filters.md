# Comprehensive Filter System Implementation Plan

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Infrastructure
1. **Filter Types Defined** - `src/platforms/gtk/ui/filters.rs` contains comprehensive filter enums and structures:
   - `FilterType`: WatchStatus, SortOrder, Genre, Year, Rating, Resolution, ContentRating
   - `WatchStatus`: All, Watched, Unwatched, InProgress
   - `SortOrder`: Title, Year, Rating, DateAdded, DateWatched (asc/desc)
   - `FilterCriterion`: Specific filter implementations
   - `FilterSet`: Container for active filters
   - `FilterManager`: Application logic for filtering

2. **Reactive Architecture** - `src/core/viewmodels/library_view_model.rs`:
   - Reactive Properties for search, filters, and sorting
   - Event-driven updates through EventBus
   - 75% complete migration to reactive ViewModels

3. **UI Infrastructure** - **UPDATED ARCHITECTURE**:
   - **Filter Controls Widget** - `src/platforms/gtk/ui/widgets/library_filters.rs` (âœ… NEW)
     - Dedicated `LibraryFilters` widget extracted from main window
     - Reusable component with callback-based architecture
     - Filter state management with `FilterState` struct
   - **Library Page** - `src/platforms/gtk/ui/pages/library.rs`:
     - Reactive search with debouncing (300ms, min 2 chars)
     - Two-way binding between UI widgets and reactive properties
     - FlowBox binding for automatic UI updates
   - **Main Window Integration** - Simplified to ~120 lines of library code (70% reduction)

4. **Data Models** - Rich metadata available:
   - Movies: title, year, rating, genres, cast, crew, added_at, watched, view_count, last_watched_at
   - Shows: title, year, rating, genres, cast, watched_episode_count, total_episode_count
   - Episodes: season/episode numbers, show metadata, duration, watch status
   - Database: SQLite with SeaORM, JSON metadata fields, proper indexing

### Current Limitations (**UPDATED - Stage 1 Complete**)
1. âœ… **UI Implementation**: LibraryFilters widget now implements all basic filter types (watch status, sort order, genre, year range, rating)
2. âœ… **Backend Integration**: FilterManager integrated with reactive ViewModels through unified enum system
3. âœ… **Basic Filter Types**: Genre, year range, rating UI fully implemented in LibraryFilters widget
4. âœ… **Backend Filtering**: Year range and rating filters fully integrated with ViewModel methods
5. **Search Integration**: Search works but not integrated with other filters
6. **Filter Persistence**: No saving/loading of user filter preferences
7. **Advanced Features**: No filter combinations, saved searches, or filter presets

### Recent Architecture Changes (âœ… COMPLETED)
- **Filter Controls Extraction**: Successfully moved filter UI from main window to dedicated `LibraryFilters` widget
- **Code Simplification**: Reduced main window library code by 70% (from ~400 to ~120 lines)
- **Reusable Component**: Filter controls are now a standalone, reusable widget with callback architecture
- **Virtual Library Removal**: Eliminated unused virtual scrolling code that was causing complexity

## Implementation Notes

### Phase Approach
- Each stage builds on the previous one
- Can be developed in parallel for different filter types
- Focus on core functionality before advanced features
- Thorough testing at each stage before proceeding

### Architectural Benefits from Library Cleanup
- **Clean Foundation**: LibraryFilters widget provides perfect starting point for filter expansion
- **Reduced Complexity**: Main window no longer cluttered with filter code
- **Reusable Design**: Filter functionality is now properly encapsulated and reusable
- **Callback Architecture**: Existing callback system makes it easy to add new filter types
- **Simplified Integration**: Main window already integrated with LibraryFilters widget

### Risk Mitigation
- **Performance Risk**: Implement caching and query optimization early
- **Complexity Risk**: Start with simple filters, add complexity gradually
- **UX Risk**: Get early user feedback on filter placement and behavior
- **Data Risk**: Handle missing/inconsistent metadata gracefully

### Future Enhancements
- AI-powered filter suggestions based on viewing history
- Social features: shared filter presets between users
- Advanced analytics: trending filters, popular combinations
- Integration with external services for enhanced metadata
