# Library Synchronization & UI Reactivity Task List

## Overview
This document outlines tasks to improve library synchronization and UI reactivity in the Reel media player. The main goal is to create a fully reactive, message-driven sync system with proper UI feedback using the MessageBroker pattern.

**Note**: EventBus is deprecated and will be removed. All event handling should use the Relm4-native MessageBroker system.

## Priority Levels
- 游댮 **Critical**: Blocking issues that cause data inconsistency or poor UX
- 游리 **High**: Important improvements for reliability and performance
- 游릭 **Medium**: Enhancements for better user experience
- 游댯 **Low**: Nice-to-have features

## 游댮 Critical: Message System Integration

### Task 0: Activate MessageBroker System
**Problem**: MessageBroker exists but is completely unused
**Location**: `src/platforms/relm4/components/shared/broker.rs`
- [x] Ensure BROKER static is properly initialized
- [x] Add helper methods for common message patterns
- [x] Create message conversion utilities for service layer
- [x] Add logging/debugging for message flow
- [x] Document MessageBroker usage patterns

### Task 1: Integrate SyncService with MessageBroker
**Problem**: SyncService bypasses the message system entirely, causing UI disconnection
**Location**: `src/services/core/sync.rs`
- [x] Remove `new_without_events()` calls from SyncRepositoryImpl (already done)
- [x] Add MessageBroker access to SyncService via BROKER static
- [x] Broadcast SourceMessage::SyncStarted at sync beginning
- [x] Broadcast DataMessage with progress during batch processing
- [x] Broadcast SourceMessage::SyncCompleted/SyncError at sync end
- [x] Update all SyncService callers to use MessageBroker (SyncService already uses BROKER)

### Task 2: Fix Progress Reporting
**Problem**: Sync progress always returns 0% due to missing total_items field
**Location**: `src/db/repository/sync_repository.rs`, `src/db/entities/sync_status.rs`
- [x] Add `total_items` column to sync_status table via migration
- [x] Update SyncStatus entity with total_items field
- [x] Implement item counting before sync starts (placeholder for now)
- [x] Calculate accurate progress percentage
- [x] Update progress during batch processing

### Task 3: Implement Repository Message Integration
**Problem**: Repository operations don't broadcast messages
**Location**: `src/db/repository/*.rs`
- [x] Remove EventBus from repository constructors
- [ ] Add MessageBroker access to repositories (when needed)
- [ ] Broadcast DataMessage::MediaUpdated from media_repository (TODO when needed)
- [ ] Broadcast DataMessage::LibraryUpdated from library_repository (TODO when needed)
- [ ] Broadcast SourceMessage for source updates (TODO when needed)
- [x] Update all repository instantiations to remove EventBus

**Location**: `src/platforms/relm4/components/pages/sources.rs`
- [x] Replace `syncing_sources` HashSet with message-driven state
- [x] Use SourceMessage::SyncStarted to set loading state
- [x] Use SourceMessage::SyncCompleted to clear loading state
- [x] Remove manual LoadData calls after sync (kept only in SyncCompleted for data refresh)

- [x] Remove EventBus from all repository implementations
- [x] Remove event_bus field from BaseRepository struct
- [x] Update all repository constructors to remove event_bus parameter
- [ ] Remove EventBus from all ViewModels (not needed for Relm4)
- [ ] Delete entire src/events/ directory including:

  - [ ] src/events/types.rs (DatabaseEvent, EventType, EventPayload - old system)
  - [ ] src/events/mod.rs
- [ ] Remove service_bridge.rs (it bridges to old event system)
- [ ] Update all backend implementations to use MessageBroker directly
- [ ] Remove all EventBus::global() calls
- [ ] Update database connection to use MessageBroker

- [ ] Repositories should directly call BROKER methods when needed
- [ ] Ensure all events flow through MessageBroker BrokerMessage types only

## Notes

- All database schema changes require migrations
- MessageBroker changes affect multiple components
- **EventBus AND src/events/ directory MUST be completely removed from the codebase**
- **Do NOT use DatabaseEvent, EventType, or EventPayload - these are part of the old system**
- Use only MessageBroker's BrokerMessage types (DataMessage, SourceMessage, etc.)
- GTK frontend is disabled and does not need to be fixed
- Relm4 components should use MessageBroker exclusively
- Repositories should directly call BROKER helper methods
- Consider backward compatibility for existing data
- Performance testing required for large libraries (10k+ items)
- Coordinate with backend team for API optimizations
