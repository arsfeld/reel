# Server Selection Optimization Task List

## Current State Analysis

### 🔴 Critical Issues

1. **Server Discovery on Every Backend Creation**
   - **Location**: `src/backends/plex/mod.rs:466`
   - **Issue**: When saved URL fails or doesn't exist, `PlexAuth::discover_servers()` is called
   - **Impact**: Network call to Plex.tv API on EVERY operation if primary URL fails
   - **Frequency**: Potentially hundreds of times per session

2. **Connection Testing on Every Initialize**
   - **Location**: `src/backends/plex/mod.rs:417-427`
   - **Issue**: Tests saved URL with 5-second timeout on every backend creation
   - **Impact**: 5+ second delay per operation if URL is unreachable
   - **Cost**: Even successful tests add 50-500ms to every operation

3. **Full Connection Racing on URL Failure**
   - **Location**: `src/backends/plex/mod.rs:512` (`find_best_connection`)
   - **Issue**: Tests ALL connections in parallel when saved URL fails
   - **Impact**: Multiple simultaneous HTTP requests per operation
   - **Worst Case**: 10+ connections tested × multiple operations = network flood

### 🟡 Suboptimal Behaviors

1. **ConnectionMonitor Frequency**
   - **Current**: Checks every 30 seconds (`connection_monitor.rs:44`)
   - **Issue**: Too frequent for stable local connections
   - **Waste**: Unnecessary network traffic for LAN servers

2. **No Connection Quality Caching**
   - **Issue**: Connection quality (local/relay) not persisted
   - **Impact**: Can't make intelligent decisions about when to re-test

3. **No Exponential Backoff**
   - **Issue**: Failed connections retried at same frequency
   - **Impact**: Wasted resources on known-bad connections

## Goal State

### Optimal Behavior

1. **Server Discovery**: Only on first authentication and manual refresh
2. **Connection Testing**:
   - On app startup
   - When current connection is suboptimal (relay/remote)
   - On connection failure
   - On manual request
3. **Frequency**:
   - Local connections: Every 5 minutes (or on failure)
   - Remote connections: Every 2 minutes
   - Relay connections: Every 30 seconds (actively seek better)
4. **Caching**: Connection quality and response times cached in memory and database

## Implementation Tasks

### Phase 1: Connection State Management
- [x] **1.1** Create `ConnectionState` struct to track quality
  ```rust
  struct ConnectionState {
      url: String,
      connection_type: ConnectionType, // Local, Remote, Relay
      last_tested: Instant,
      response_time_ms: u64,
      failure_count: u32,
      next_check: Instant,
  }
  ```
  - File: Created `src/services/core/connection_cache.rs`
  - Implemented quality assessment logic
  - Added exponential backoff for failures

- [x] **1.2** Add connection state to database schema
  - Added `connection_quality` column to sources table
  - Added `last_connection_test` timestamp
  - Added `connection_failure_count` counter
  - Migration: `src/db/migrations/m20250105_000001_add_connection_tracking.rs`

- [x] **1.3** Create global ConnectionCache service
  ```rust
  pub struct ConnectionCache {
      states: Arc<RwLock<LruCache<SourceId, ConnectionState>>>,
  }
  ```
  - Implemented as global static with lazy_static
  - Memory cache with TTL based on connection quality
  - File: `src/services/core/connection_cache.rs`

### Phase 2: Optimize PlexBackend Initialization
- [x] **2.1** Skip discovery if good connection cached
  - Modified `PlexBackend::initialize()`
  - Check ConnectionCache before discovery
  - Only discover if no valid cached connection

- [x] **2.2** Skip URL testing for recent validations
  - Modified test at lines 417-427
  - Check last test timestamp via ConnectionCache
  - Skip if tested within TTL window

- [x] **2.3** Add fast-path for local connections
  - Integrated ConnectionCache with should_skip_test
  - Uses cached connection without testing when within TTL
  - Different TTLs for local (5min), remote (2min), relay (30s)

### Phase 3: Intelligent Connection Monitoring
- [x] **3.1** Variable frequency based on connection quality
  ```rust
  fn calculate_check_interval(conn_type: ConnectionType) -> Duration {
      match conn_type {
          ConnectionType::Local => Duration::from_secs(300),    // 5 min
          ConnectionType::Remote => Duration::from_secs(120),   // 2 min
          ConnectionType::Relay => Duration::from_secs(30),     // 30 sec
      }
  }
  ```
  - Updated `ConnectionMonitor` to use variable intervals
  - File: `src/platforms/relm4/components/workers/connection_monitor.rs`
  - Added per-source tracking of next check times

- [x] **3.2** Priority-based connection checking
  - Check relay connections more frequently (30s)
  - Check remote connections when idle (2min)
  - Check local connections rarely (5min)
  - Implemented in ConnectionMonitor with HashMap tracking

- [ ] **3.3** Implement connection upgrade detection
  - When on relay, actively seek direct connections
  - When on remote, periodically check for local
  - Notify user when better connection found

### Phase 4: Server Discovery Optimization
- [ ] **4.1** Cache discovered servers
  - Store in database with TTL (24 hours)
  - Refresh only on auth changes or manual request
  - Add `discovered_servers` JSON column

- [ ] **4.2** Implement discovery refresh strategy
  ```rust
  enum DiscoveryTrigger {
      FirstAuth,           // Never discovered before
      AuthChanged,         // Token refreshed
      ManualRefresh,       // User requested
      ConnectionFailure,   // All connections failed
      Stale,              // Cache > 24 hours old
  }
  ```

- [ ] **4.3** Add manual refresh action
  - UI button in Sources page
  - Keyboard shortcut
  - Command in troubleshooting menu

### Phase 5: Performance Optimizations
- [ ] **5.1** Implement connection pooling
  - Reuse HTTP clients across backend instances
  - Share TLS sessions for same host
  - File: `src/services/core/http_pool.rs`

- [ ] **5.2** Add predictive pre-warming
  - Test connections before user action
  - Pre-warm during idle time
  - Priority queue based on usage patterns

- [ ] **5.3** Implement circuit breaker pattern
  ```rust
  struct CircuitBreaker {
      failure_threshold: u32,
      reset_timeout: Duration,
      state: BreakerState,
  }
  ```
  - Prevent repeated attempts to dead servers
  - Automatic recovery with exponential backoff

### Phase 6: Metrics and Monitoring

  - Success/failure rates
  - Response time percentiles
  - Connection type distribution

- [ ] **6.2** Implement connection health dashboard
  - Show current connections and quality
  - Historical performance graphs
  - Manual test buttons

- [ ] **6.3** Add telemetry events

  - Discovery triggers
  - Performance degradation alerts

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests
- [ ] ConnectionState serialization/deserialization
- [ ] TTL calculation logic
- [ ] Circuit breaker state transitions
- [ ] Priority scoring with cache consideration

### Integration Tests
- [ ] Cached connection reuse
- [ ] Failover with stale cache
- [ ] Discovery bypass on good connection
- [ ] Variable monitoring intervals

### Performance Tests
- [ ] Measure backend creation time (target: <50ms with cache)
- [ ] Network calls per session (target: 90% reduction)
- [ ] Connection failover time (target: <2s)

## Success Metrics

### Before Optimization
- Backend creation: 500-5000ms
- Network calls: 1 per operation
- Discovery calls: Multiple per session
- Connection tests: Every operation

### After Optimization (Target)
- Backend creation: <50ms (cached), <500ms (uncached)
- Network calls: <0.1 per operation average
- Discovery calls: <1 per day average
- Connection tests: Based on quality (5min/2min/30s)

## Implementation Order

1. **Week 1**: Phase 1 (Connection State) + Phase 2 (Backend Optimization)
2. **Week 2**: Phase 3 (Intelligent Monitoring)
3. **Week 3**: Phase 4 (Discovery Optimization)
4. **Week 4**: Phase 5 (Performance) + Phase 6 (Metrics)

## Risk Mitigation

### Potential Issues
1. **Stale connections**: Mitigated by TTL and quality-based refresh
2. **Missing failover**: Circuit breaker ensures fallback
3. **Cache invalidation**: Event-driven updates on failures
4. **Memory leaks**: Bounded cache with LRU eviction

### Rollback Plan
- Feature flag: `ENABLE_CONNECTION_CACHE`
- Gradual rollout with metrics monitoring
- Easy disable via environment variable

## Dependencies

- No external crate additions required
- Uses existing tokio, Arc, RwLock
- Database migration backward compatible

## Implementation Notes

### Key Files Modified
- `src/services/core/connection_cache.rs` - New ConnectionCache service
- `src/services/core/connection.rs` - Added caching logic to ConnectionService
- `src/backends/plex/mod.rs` - Modified initialize() to use cache
- `src/platforms/relm4/components/workers/connection_monitor.rs` - Variable frequency monitoring
- `src/db/migrations/m20250105_000001_add_connection_tracking.rs` - Database schema updates
- `src/db/entities/sources.rs` - Added tracking fields to entity

### Design Decisions
1. **Global Static Cache**: Used lazy_static for singleton pattern to share cache across all backends
2. **LRU with 100 item limit**: Prevents unbounded memory growth while supporting typical use cases
3. **Exponential Backoff**: Failures trigger exponential backoff (30s * 2^n) capped at 10 minutes
4. **Quality-Based TTL**: Different cache durations based on connection type for optimal balance
5. **Non-blocking**: Cache checks never block operations - stale data preferred over blocking

### Testing Considerations
- Cache behavior can be observed via tracing logs (debug level)
- ConnectionMonitor logs check frequency at info level
- Database fields track last test time and failure counts for debugging
- Manual testing: Start app, check logs for "Skipping URL test due to recent cache"

### Known Limitations
- Cache is not persisted across app restarts (intentional for fresh start)
- No manual cache invalidation UI (could be added to preferences)
- Circuit breaker pattern not yet implemented (Phase 5)
