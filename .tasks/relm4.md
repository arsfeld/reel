# Relm4 UI Implementation Checklist

**üö® PRIORITY CHANGE**: Relm4 is now the DEFAULT and PRIMARY UI implementation.
- GTK implementation is DEPRECATED but serves as UI/UX reference
- All new development happens in Relm4
- No more ViewModel pattern - pure Relm4 components with trackers
- **IMPORTANT**: Keep GTK4/libadwaita styling and UI patterns - just reimplement with Relm4 architecture

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Type Safety Dependencies

**IMPORTANT**: The Relm4 implementation depends on the type-safety refactoring being completed in parallel or first.

### Critical Dependencies from Type-Safety Checklist:
1. **Phase 1 (Core Type Definitions)** - ‚úÖ COMPLETED
   - SourceId, LibraryId, MediaItemId, ShowId, etc.
   - All typed IDs are now available for use in Relm4 components!

2. **Phase 2 (CacheKey System)** - Required for proper cache interaction
   - CacheKey enum to replace string-based keys
   - Should be done early to avoid refactoring Relm4 components later

3. **Phase 3-4 (Service Updates)** - DataService and SyncManager type safety
   - Can be done in parallel with Relm4 development
   - Relm4 components will adapt to new signatures as they're updated

### Coordination Strategy:
- ‚úÖ Type-safety Phase 1 COMPLETE - typed IDs ready to use!
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Start type-safety Phase 2 (CacheKey) ASAP to avoid refactoring
- Relm4 development can proceed NOW with typed IDs
- Use typed IDs (SourceId, LibraryId, etc.) in ALL new Relm4 components
- Service updates (Phase 3-4) can happen in parallel

### 4. üé¨ Player Component - **PHASE 1 LARGELY COMPLETE**

#### **üí° Critical Architecture Decision**
The existing player backends (MPV 52KB + GStreamer 49KB) are complex, platform-specific, and WORKING.
**Strategy**: WRAP don't REWRITE. Create thin Relm4 wrapper around existing `src/player/` code.

#### **üéØ Implementation Plan**

##### **Phase 1: Minimal Viable Player (2-3 days)** - **MAJOR PROGRESS**
- [‚úÖ] Create `src/platforms/relm4/components/pages/player.rs` as AsyncComponent - **COMPLETE**
- [‚úÖ] Reuse existing `Player` enum from `src/player/factory.rs` AS-IS - **COMPLETE: Fully integrated**
- [üü°] Integrate GLArea widget for MPV OpenGL rendering - **TODO: Next increment**
- [‚úÖ] Basic playback commands (Load, Play, Pause, Seek) - **COMPLETE: Connected to real backends**
- [‚úÖ] Simple overlay with play/pause and seek bar - **COMPLETE: Reactive state management**
- [‚úÖ] Position tracking worker (1Hz updates) - **COMPLETE: Command-based implementation**
- [‚úÖ] MainWindow navigation integration - **COMPLETE: Play buttons launch player**
- [‚úÖ] Error handling and command pattern - **COMPLETE: PlayerCommandOutput enum**

##### **Phase 2: Full OSD Controls (1-2 days)**
- [ ] **KEEP GTK4 OSD**: Port overlay controls to Relm4 view!
- [ ] **KEEP GTK4 STYLE**: Same seek bar, volume slider, buttons
- [ ] Controls auto-hide timer (3 seconds)
- [ ] Fullscreen toggle with F11 key
- [ ] Volume control with mouse wheel
- [ ] Settings menu (quality, audio/subtitle tracks)

##### **Phase 3: Advanced Features (2-3 days)**
- [ ] Chapter markers (skip intro/credits buttons)
- [ ] Auto-play next episode with countdown overlay
- [ ] Audio/subtitle track selection dialogs
- [ ] Playback speed control (0.5x - 2.0x)
- [ ] Picture-in-Picture mode
- [ ] Screensaver inhibition

#### **üîß Technical Implementation**

##### **Component Structure**:
```rust
pub struct PlayerPage {
    // Core player (unchanged)
    player: Arc<RwLock<Player>>,
    gl_area: GLArea,

    // Relm4 state
    media_item: Option<MediaItem>,
    playback_state: PlaybackState,
    position: Duration,
    duration: Duration,
    volume: f64,

    // UI state
    show_controls: bool,
    is_fullscreen: bool,
    controls_timer: Option<SourceId>,
}
```

##### **Command Pattern**:
- [ ] `LoadMediaCommand` - Fetch stream URL and initialize player
- [ ] `PlayCommand` - Start/resume playback
- [ ] `PauseCommand` - Pause playback
- [ ] `SeekCommand` - Jump to position
- [ ] `SetVolumeCommand` - Adjust volume (0.0 - 1.0)
- [ ] `SetTrackCommand` - Switch audio/subtitle track
- [ ] `SetQualityCommand` - Change stream quality
- [ ] `ToggleFullscreenCommand` - Enter/exit fullscreen

##### **Worker Components**:
- [ ] `PlaybackTracker` - Position updates every second
- [ ] `AutoPlayManager` - Next episode countdown
- [ ] `ChapterDetector` - Intro/credits detection
- [ ] `ProgressSaver` - Database sync every 10 seconds

#### **‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Implementation Notes**

1. **OpenGL Context**:
   - MUST initialize in GLArea `connect_realize` signal
   - MPV requires `LC_NUMERIC=C` locale
   - Use `queue_render()` for frame updates

2. **Platform Specifics**:
   - macOS: MPV preferred, GStreamer fallback
   - Linux: Both work, MPV default
   - Factory already handles selection

3. **Performance**:
   - Position updates max 1Hz (not per frame!)
   - Throttle seek events during dragging
   - Cache textures for overlay icons

4. **Thread Safety**:
   - Player already Arc<RwLock<>> wrapped
   - All commands must be async
   - UI updates only on main thread

#### **üõ°Ô∏è Risk Mitigation**

- **DO NOT** modify `src/player/mpv_player.rs` or `gstreamer_player.rs`
- **DO NOT** change OpenGL rendering logic
- **DO** reuse `Player::create_video_widget()` method
- **DO** keep factory backend selection logic
- **DO** test with both backends regularly

#### **‚úÖ Success Metrics**
- [ ] Video plays smoothly in Relm4 window
- [ ] Position updates without stuttering
- [ ] Seek works without delays
- [ ] Fullscreen transitions smoothly
- [ ] Controls auto-hide properly
- [ ] Database saves progress
- [ ] Auto-play next episode works
- [ ] Both MPV and GStreamer backends functional

### 5. Create Playback Worker - **Integrated with Player**
- [ ] Create `src/platforms/relm4/components/workers/playback_tracker.rs`
  - [ ] Progress tracking every second (1Hz polling)
  - [ ] Database sync every 10 seconds
  - [ ] Resume position management
  - [ ] Auto-play countdown (10 second timer)
  - [ ] Chapter marker detection
  - [ ] End-of-media handling for next episode
  - [ ] Watched status updates (>90% = watched)

  - [‚ùå] No async command execution infrastructure
  - [‚ùå] Type-safe command parameters needed
- [üü°] **MessageBroker Pattern**: Replace EventBus with typed brokers - **WRONG PATTERN**

## Summary of Changes

### What's Different from Original Plan
1. **NO ViewModels** - Components manage their own state
2. **Tracker Pattern Everywhere** - Efficient minimal updates
3. **Factory Pattern Required** - All lists/grids use factories
4. **AsyncComponents Default** - Data pages are async
5. **Workers for Background** - All heavy ops in workers
6. **Commands for Async** - Structured async operations
7. **MessageBroker** - Replaces custom event bus
8. **KEEP GTK4 UI/UX** - Exact same look and feel, just Relm4 architecture
9. **Stateless Services** - No Arc<Self>, pure functions only
10. **Type-Safe Everything** - IDs, cache keys, messages all typed
11. **Service Architecture** - Organized into core/workers/commands/brokers

### Key Benefits
- **Performance**: Minimal re-renders with trackers
- **Simplicity**: No dual state management
- **Type Safety**: Pure Relm4 patterns
