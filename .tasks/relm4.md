# Relm4 UI Implementation Checklist

**üö® PRIORITY CHANGE**: Relm4 is now the DEFAULT and PRIMARY UI implementation.
- GTK implementation is DEPRECATED but serves as UI/UX reference
- All new development happens in Relm4
- No more ViewModel pattern - pure Relm4 components with trackers
- **IMPORTANT**: Keep GTK4/libadwaita styling and UI patterns - just reimplement with Relm4 architecture

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Type Safety Dependencies

**IMPORTANT**: The Relm4 implementation depends on the type-safety refactoring being completed in parallel or first.

### Critical Dependencies from Type-Safety Checklist:
1. **Phase 1 (Core Type Definitions)** - ‚úÖ COMPLETED
   - SourceId, LibraryId, MediaItemId, ShowId, etc.
   - All typed IDs are now available for use in Relm4 components!

2. **Phase 2 (CacheKey System)** - Required for proper cache interaction
   - CacheKey enum to replace string-based keys
   - Should be done early to avoid refactoring Relm4 components later

3. **Phase 3-4 (Service Updates)** - DataService and SyncManager type safety
   - Can be done in parallel with Relm4 development
   - Relm4 components will adapt to new signatures as they're updated

### Coordination Strategy:
- ‚úÖ Type-safety Phase 1 COMPLETE - typed IDs ready to use!
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Start type-safety Phase 2 (CacheKey) ASAP to avoid refactoring
- Relm4 development can proceed NOW with typed IDs
- Use typed IDs (SourceId, LibraryId, etc.) in ALL new Relm4 components
- Service updates (Phase 3-4) can happen in parallel
