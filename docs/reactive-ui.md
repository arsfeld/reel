# Reactive UI Architecture Documentation

## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive analysis of the reactive UI architecture implemented in the GNOME Reel application. The application demonstrates a modern reactive approach using ViewModels, Properties, and an EventBus for state management and UI updates.

## Architecture Overview

### Core Components

#### 1. Property System (`src/ui/viewmodels/property.rs`)

The foundation of our reactive architecture is the `Property<T>` system, which provides:

- **Observable State**: Properties are wrapped in `Arc<RwLock<T>>` for thread-safe access
- **Change Notifications**: Built on `tokio::sync::broadcast` for efficient multi-subscriber updates
- **Subscription Model**: Each property can have multiple subscribers via `PropertySubscriber`
- **Lagged Broadcast Tolerance**: Subscribers gracefully handle broadcast lag, preventing dropped updates

```rust
pub struct Property<T: Clone + Send + Sync> {
    value: Arc<RwLock<T>>,
    sender: broadcast::Sender<()>,
    name: String,
}
```

Key features:
- `set()`: Updates value and notifies all subscribers
- `update()`: Mutates value in-place with a closure
- `subscribe()`: Returns a unique `PropertySubscriber` for change notifications
- `ComputedProperty`: Automatically updates based on dependencies

#### 2. ViewModel Pattern (`src/ui/viewmodels/`)

ViewModels act as the reactive layer between data services and UI components:

**Base Trait**:
```rust
#[async_trait]
pub trait ViewModel: Send + Sync {
    async fn initialize(&self, event_bus: Arc<EventBus>);
    fn subscribe_to_property(&self, property_name: &str) -> Option<PropertySubscriber>;
    async fn refresh(&self);
    fn dispose(&self);
}
```

**Implemented ViewModels**:
- `LibraryViewModel`: Manages library content with filtering, sorting, and batch updates
- `DetailsViewModel`: Handles media details with targeted updates on MediaUpdated events
- `PlayerViewModel`: Controls playback state reactively
- `HomeViewModel`: Manages homepage content sections
- `SidebarViewModel`: Handles navigation state
- `SourcesViewModel`: Manages backend sources

#### 3. EventBus System (`src/events/event_bus.rs`)

Central nervous system for application-wide reactive updates:

- **Typed Events**: Strongly-typed event system with `DatabaseEvent` and `EventPayload`
- **Filtered Subscriptions**: `EventFilter` allows selective event listening
- **Priority System**: Events have priority levels for handling importance
- **Event History**: Maintains recent events for debugging
- **Statistics**: Tracks event metrics for performance monitoring

```rust
pub struct EventBus {
    sender: broadcast::Sender<DatabaseEvent>,
    stats: Arc<RwLock<EventBusStats>>,
    event_history: Arc<RwLock<Vec<DatabaseEvent>>>,
}
```

## Reactive Patterns in Use

### 1. Property-Based Reactivity

**Strengths**:
- Clean separation between state and UI
- Automatic UI updates via subscriptions
- Thread-safe concurrent access
- No manual state synchronization needed

**Example**: LibraryViewModel filtered items
```rust
// ViewModel updates filtered items
self.filtered_items.set(filtered).await;

// UI subscribes and reacts
let mut subscriber = view_model.filtered_items().subscribe();
while subscriber.wait_for_change().await {
    let items = vm.filtered_items().get().await;
    view.update_items_from_viewmodel(items);
}
```

### 2. Event-Driven Updates

**DetailsViewModel** demonstrates sophisticated event handling:
- Subscribes to `MediaUpdated`, `MediaDeleted`, `PlaybackPositionUpdated` events
- Performs targeted, in-place updates without UI disruption
- Maintains UI state during background updates

```rust
async fn handle_event(&self, event: DatabaseEvent) {
    if let EventType::MediaUpdated = event.event_type {
        // Targeted update without toggling is_loading
        self.merge_updated_data(updated_item).await;
    }
}
```

### 3. Batch Update Strategy

**LibraryViewModel** implements intelligent batching:
- Debounces rapid updates (250ms window)
- Merges incremental changes during sync
- Prevents UI thrashing during bulk operations

```rust
struct UpdateBatch {
    last_update: Option<Instant>,
    pending_refresh: bool,
}
```

## Areas of Excellence

### 1. Fully Reactive Components

- **ViewModels**: All ViewModels properly implement reactive patterns
- **Property System**: Robust, thread-safe observable implementation
- **EventBus**: Well-designed pub-sub system with filtering
- **Subscription Management**: Proper cleanup and lifecycle handling

### 2. Smart Update Strategies

- **Incremental Updates**: LibraryViewModel merges changes without full refresh
- **Targeted Updates**: DetailsViewModel updates specific fields
- **Debouncing**: Prevents excessive UI updates during sync

### 3. Clean Architecture

- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundaries between UI, ViewModels, and Services
- **Type Safety**: Strongly-typed events and properties
- **Testability**: ViewModels can be tested independently of UI

## Areas Needing Improvement

### 1. Remaining Imperative Code

#### UI Pages Still Using RefCell Pattern
The UI pages (`src/ui/pages/`) still heavily rely on GTK's imperative patterns:

- **649 occurrences** of `imp()`, `.borrow()`, `.replace()` in pages
- Direct manipulation of GTK widgets instead of declarative binding
- Manual state management with `RefCell`

**Example of current imperative approach**:
```rust
// Current imperative pattern in library.rs
self.imp().filtered_items.replace(items);
if let Some(flow_box) = self.imp().flow_box.borrow().as_ref() {
    flow_box.remove_all();
    // Manual widget creation and insertion
}
```

**Recommended reactive approach**:
```rust
// Proposed declarative binding
view_model.filtered_items
    .bind_to(&flow_box.items)
    .with_transform(|items| create_widgets(items));
```

#### Direct Service Calls from UI
Some UI components still make direct service calls instead of going through ViewModels:
- Player page directly manages GStreamer
- Authentication dialog bypasses ViewModel layer
- Preferences window directly modifies state

### 2. Missing Reactive Patterns

#### No Computed Properties in Use
While `ComputedProperty` is implemented, it's not utilized:
- Filter results could be computed from search + items
- Playback progress percentage could be computed
- UI visibility states could be derived

#### Limited Two-Way Binding
Current implementation is mostly one-way (ViewModel â†’ UI):
- Form inputs require manual event handling
- Settings changes need explicit handlers
- Search/filter inputs lack declarative binding

#### No Reactive Collections
Arrays/Vecs are replaced wholesale instead of using reactive collections:
- Could implement `ObservableList` with add/remove/update events
- Would enable efficient UI updates for large lists
- Reduce memory churn during updates

### 3. Event System Gaps

#### Missing Event Types
- UI interaction events (navigation, selection)
- Configuration change events
- Network status events
- Error events with context

#### No Event Replay/Sourcing
- Can't replay events for debugging
- No event persistence for crash recovery
- Missing undo/redo capability

#### Limited Event Metadata
- No correlation IDs for tracking related events
- Missing timestamps in some events
- No user/session context

### 4. Performance Considerations

#### Subscription Leaks Risk
- Some subscriptions may not be properly cleaned up
- Missing weak references in some closures
- Potential memory leaks in long-running subscriptions

#### Excessive Cloning
- Properties clone values on get()
- Could use `Arc` for large data structures
- Consider copy-on-write semantics

#### No Subscription Batching
- Multiple property changes trigger multiple updates
- Could batch subscriptions in same tick
- Missing transaction-like updates

## Conclusion

The GNOME Reel application demonstrates a solid foundation for reactive UI with its Property system, ViewModels, and EventBus. The architecture successfully separates concerns and provides reactive updates for most components.

However, significant opportunities exist to enhance the reactive nature of the application, particularly in the UI layer where GTK's imperative patterns still dominate. By addressing the identified gaps and implementing the recommended improvements, the application can achieve a fully reactive architecture that is more maintainable, performant, and developer-friendly.

The gradual migration path suggested allows for incremental improvements without disrupting the existing functionality, making it practical to evolve the architecture while maintaining stability.
