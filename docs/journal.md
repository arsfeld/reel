# Relm4 Migration Journal

## Project Overview
Reel is migrating from a GTK4/ViewModel architecture to a fully Relm4-based reactive UI system. This journal tracks the major milestones and decisions made during the migration.

## Architecture Evolution

### Original State (December 2024)
- GTK4 with custom ViewModel pattern
- EventBus for inter-component communication
- Mix of ViewModels and direct UI manipulation
- Backend services with Arc<Self> patterns

### Target Architecture (Relm4)
- Pure component-based reactive system
- AsyncComponents for data-heavy pages
- Factory pattern for all collections
- Worker components for background tasks
- Command pattern for structured async operations
- MessageBroker replacing custom EventBus
- Stateless services with pure functions

## Major Milestones

### Phase 0: Foundation (December 2024)
✅ **Completed**: Set up Relm4 infrastructure
- Configured Relm4 as default platform
- Created service architecture with stateless patterns
- Implemented typed IDs throughout (LibraryId, MediaItemId, etc.)
- Fixed 54 compilation errors to get project building

### Week 1: Core Components (Late December 2024)
✅ **Completed**: Established component foundation
- Created ReelApp AsyncComponent as root
- Implemented MainWindow with NavigationSplitView
- Built Sidebar with factory pattern for sources
- Proved factory pattern with SourceItem component
- Implemented 24+ commands across media, auth, and sync domains

### Week 2: Pages & Navigation (Early January 2025)
✅ **Completed**: Built main UI pages
- MediaCard factory with hover effects and progress bars
- Library page with virtual scrolling and pagination
- HomePage with Continue Watching and Recently Added
- MovieDetails page with full metadata and playback
- ShowDetails page with seasons and episodes
- Navigation system working end-to-end

### Week 3: Player Integration (Mid January 2025)
✅ **Completed**: Video playback system
- Wrapped existing MPV/GStreamer backends (100KB+ code preserved)
- Created PlayerPage AsyncComponent
- Implemented OSD controls with auto-hide
- Added keyboard shortcuts (Space, F11, ESC)
- Fixed thread-safety issues with channel-based controller
- Stateless BackendService for stream URL resolution

### Critical Architecture Fix (January 14, 2025)
✅ **Major Success**: Fixed fundamental architecture issue
- **Problem**: app.rs had duplicate hardcoded UI, never used MainWindow
- **Solution**: MainWindow now properly runs as root component via `app.run_async::<MainWindow>(db)`
- **Result**: Proper Adwaita structure with per-pane ToolbarViews

### Backend & Authentication (January 14, 2025)
✅ **Completed**: Source management and sync
- Fixed sidebar to load real data from database
- Implemented Plex OAuth flow with server discovery
- Added Jellyfin authentication with credentials
- Created sources page with add/remove/test/sync
- Implemented multi-connection architecture for Plex servers
- Added ConnectionMonitor worker for automatic failover

## Current Status (January 14, 2025)

### Implementation Metrics
- **Overall Completion**: ~85%
- **Pages**: 6/8 functional (75%)
- **Workers**: 3/3 functional (100%)
- **Factories**: 3/3 functional (100%)
- **Commands**: ~90% functional
- **Authentication**: Both Plex and Jellyfin working

### Working Features
✅ Application compiles and launches correctly
✅ Database initialization and connections
✅ Source management (add/remove/sync)
✅ Library browsing with pagination
✅ Media playback with OSD controls
✅ Continue watching tracking
✅ Search functionality (basic)
✅ Navigation between all pages

### Outstanding Issues (23 TODOs found)
- Preferences not persisting to config/database
- Image loading disconnected from ImageWorker
- Cache clearing non-functional
- Toast notifications missing for errors
- View mode switch doesn't update layout
- Genres not populated in search
- Person images using placeholders
- Some library counts still placeholder values

## Key Technical Decisions

### 1. Stateless Services
Replaced Arc<Self> pattern with pure functions, eliminating hidden dependencies and thread-safety issues.

### 2. Wrap, Don't Rewrite
Preserved 100KB+ of player backend code by wrapping with thin Relm4 components rather than rewriting.

### 3. Multi-Connection Architecture
Implemented automatic connection selection for Plex (local > remote > relay) with background monitoring.

### 4. Factory Pattern Everywhere
All collections use FactoryVecDeque for efficient updates and virtual scrolling.

### 5. Command Pattern
Structured async operations with proper lifecycle management and error handling.

## Lessons Learned

### Successes
- Incremental migration strategy worked well
- Factory pattern provides excellent performance
- Command pattern simplifies async complexity
- Wrapping existing code saved significant time

### Challenges
- Initial architecture confusion with MainWindow usage
- Thread-safety issues with player backends required channel-based solution
- Authentication flow complexity with multiple servers per account
- Coordination between workers and components needed careful design

### Best Practices Discovered
- Always use typed IDs for type safety
- Prefer stateless services over stateful managers
- Use tracker pattern for minimal re-renders
- Channel-based communication for thread boundaries
- Test components in isolation before integration

## Next Phase Planning

### Priority 1: Data Persistence
- Implement preferences saving
- Complete watched status persistence
- Fix image loader integration

### Priority 2: UI Polish
- Add toast notifications
- Implement about dialog
- Fix view mode switching
- Add contextual search placeholders

### Priority 3: Performance
- Complete LRU cache for images
- Optimize virtual scrolling
- Profile and reduce memory usage

## Migration Timeline
- **December 2024**: Foundation and setup (2 weeks)
- **Early January 2025**: Core components and pages (1 week)
- **Mid January 2025**: Player and authentication (1 week)
- **Estimated Completion**: End of January 2025

## Success Metrics Achieved
✅ App launches with Relm4 by default
✅ Command pattern implemented (24+ commands)
✅ Factory pattern proven for collections
✅ Service architecture working with typed IDs
✅ Foundation ready for final polish phase
