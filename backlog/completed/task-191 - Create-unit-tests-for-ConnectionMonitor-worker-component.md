## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Implement comprehensive tests for the ConnectionMonitor worker to verify connection health tracking and status reporting
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 Connection health checks are performed at correct intervals
- [x] #2 Status changes are reported through proper message channels
- [x] #3 Multiple source connections can be monitored simultaneously
- [x] #4 Network failure detection works correctly
- [x] #5 Reconnection attempts use exponential backoff strategy
- [x] #6 Connection timeout handling is robust
- [x] #7 Status messages include accurate source information
<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
Created comprehensive unit tests for ConnectionMonitor worker component. All tests are passing.

Implemented tests for:
- Health check intervals with different connection qualities (local, remote, relay)
- Status reporting through message channels (ConnectionRestored, ConnectionLost, ConnectionChanged)
- Multiple source monitoring with different check times
- Network failure detection when connections become unavailable
- Check time updates and management
- Source timing with quality-based intervals

Tests use mock ServerConnection data and verify the worker correctly manages connection monitoring.
