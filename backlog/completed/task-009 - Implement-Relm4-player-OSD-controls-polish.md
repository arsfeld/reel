## Description

The Relm4 player controls lack the polished OSD (On-Screen Display) styling and behavior from the GTK implementation. Controls should appear as floating overlays with proper transparency, auto-hide behavior, and smooth animations.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 Apply OSD styling to player controls (transparency, shadows)
- [x] #2 Implement smooth fade in/out animations for controls
- [x] #3 Add auto-hide timer (3 seconds) for controls and cursor
- [x] #4 Show controls on mouse movement or key press
- [x] #5 Style buttons with circular OSD appearance
- [x] #6 Position controls correctly (top-left back, top-right fullscreen, bottom playback)
<!-- AC:END -->


## Implementation Plan

1. Review current OSD control implementation
2. Add CSS classes for OSD styling
3. Implement fade animations using opacity transitions
4. Verify auto-hide timer is working (already implemented)
5. Ensure controls show on interaction
6. Polish button styling with circular appearance
7. Verify control positioning in overlay


## Implementation Notes

Completed full implementation of polished OSD player controls:

1. **CSS Styling**: Implemented premium Apple TV/Infuse-inspired glass-morphism effects with proper gradients, shadows, and backdrop filters for a high-quality appearance.

2. **Control Layout**: Integrated complete three-section control layout directly into the view macro:
   - Left section: Volume slider with icon
   - Center section: Previous, Rewind, Play/Pause, Forward, Next buttons
   - Right section: Audio, Subtitle, Quality menu buttons and Fullscreen

3. **Animations**: Enhanced fade in/out animations with smooth transitions, blur effects, and scale transforms for a polished feel.

4. **Auto-hide**: Auto-hide timer (3 seconds) for controls and cursor is already working from previous implementation.

5. **Button Styling**: Applied circular OSD appearance to main controls with proper hover states and transitions.

6. **Positioning**: Controls correctly positioned with top-left back button, top-right fullscreen, and bottom playback controls.

All controls now have a premium, polished appearance matching high-quality media players like Infuse and Apple TV.
