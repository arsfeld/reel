## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Fix the 4 failing tests in the Plex backend test suite that were identified during task-189 implementation. These tests are failing due to async/timing issues and need to be debugged and corrected to achieve full test coverage.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 Stream URL generation test passes consistently
- [x] #2 Progress update test correctly mocks the scrobble API
- [x] #3 Rate limiting retry test handles 429 responses properly
- [x] #4 Show fetching test retrieves and parses show data correctly
- [x] #5 All 12 Plex backend tests pass without failures
<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
All Plex backend tests are now passing successfully. The issues that were previously causing test failures have been resolved. Running 'cargo test plex' shows all 12 tests pass without any failures.
