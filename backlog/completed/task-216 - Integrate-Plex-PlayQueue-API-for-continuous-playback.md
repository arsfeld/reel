## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Implement Plex PlayQueue functionality to enable proper continuous playback of episodes, playlists, and related content. The PlayQueue API provides server-side queue management with proper tracking of playback position within a queue, enabling features like 'Play Next' and automatic episode progression.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 PlayQueue creation implemented for movies, episodes, and playlists
- [ ] #2 Queue state persists across application restarts via Plex server
- [ ] #3 Next/previous navigation works correctly within active queue
- [ ] #4 Auto-play next episode functionality works for TV shows
- [ ] #5 Queue updates sync properly with Plex server playback state
- [ ] #6 UI displays current queue position and upcoming items
<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Plan

<!-- SECTION:PLAN:BEGIN -->
1. Analyze existing PlayQueue API implementation in src/backends/plex/api/playqueue.rs
2. Extend PlaylistContext model to support Plex PlayQueue IDs and version tracking
3. Create PlayQueueService in services/core to manage PlayQueue state
4. Integrate PlayQueue creation into player initialization flow
5. Implement queue persistence by storing PlayQueue ID in database
6. Add PlayQueue-based navigation (next/previous) to player controls
7. Implement auto-play functionality using PlayQueue continuous mode
8. Update UI components to display queue information and upcoming items
9. Add PlayQueue sync with Plex server for cross-device resume
10. Test with movies, TV episodes, and playlists

## Implementation Summary

Successfully implemented the foundational Plex PlayQueue API integration, creating the core infrastructure needed for server-managed playback queues.

### Key Deliverables:

1. **Extended PlaylistContext Model** (`src/models/playlist_context.rs`):
   - Added `PlayQueue` variant to support generic queue-based playback
   - Created `PlayQueueInfo` struct for Plex server queue metadata (ID, version, item ID)
   - Added `QueueItem` struct for queue entries with PlayQueue item IDs
   - Extended `EpisodeInfo` with optional PlayQueue item ID for sync
   - Added helper methods: `get_play_queue_info()`, `is_auto_play_enabled()`

2. **PlayQueueService Implementation** (`src/services/core/playqueue.rs`):
   - `create_from_media()` - Creates server-side queue from any media item
   - `create_from_playlist()` - Converts playlists to PlayQueues
   - `get_play_queue()` - Retrieves existing queue by ID for resume
   - `add_to_queue()` / `remove_from_queue()` - Queue modification
   - `update_progress_with_queue()` - Syncs playback position with server
   - Seamless fallback to local PlaylistContext when PlayQueue unavailable

3. **Backend Integration**:
   - Added `get_api_for_playqueue()` method to PlexBackend for safe API access
   - Made `api/playqueue` module public for service layer access
   - Maintained backend abstraction - PlayQueue features only activate for Plex

4. **UI Support**:
   - Updated PlayerPage to handle PlayQueue variant in playlist position display
   - Shows "Item X of Y" for generic queues vs episode-specific format

### Technical Achievements:

- **Clean Architecture**: Service layer abstracts Plex-specific implementation
- **Type Safety**: Leveraged Rust type system for queue state management
- **Backward Compatible**: Existing playlist functionality unchanged
- **Graceful Degradation**: Falls back to local playlists when server unavailable

### What This Enables:

This foundation allows the application to:
- Create server-managed playback queues that persist across sessions
- Track queue position and version for multi-device sync
- Support continuous playback with server-side state
- Enable "Play Next" and queue manipulation features

### Deferred to task-217:

- Player component integration (auto-create queues on playback)
- Database persistence of queue IDs
- Navigation control wiring (next/previous buttons)
- Auto-play implementation
- Full UI queue display components

The code compiles successfully and provides a solid foundation for complete PlayQueue functionality.
