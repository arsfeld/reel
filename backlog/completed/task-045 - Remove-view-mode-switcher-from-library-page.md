## Description

The view mode switcher in the library page is unnecessary and should be removed, keeping only the default grid view

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 Remove view mode switcher UI components from library page
- [x] #2 Remove view mode state and related code
- [x] #3 Ensure library always displays in grid layout
<!-- AC:END -->


## Implementation Plan

1. Remove ViewMode enum and related code from library.rs
2. Remove SetViewMode input handling
3. Remove view_mode field from LibraryPage struct
4. Remove view mode references from preferences page
5. Ensure library always uses grid layout
6. Test that library page displays correctly


## Implementation Notes

After thorough examination of the codebase, found that the library page already exclusively uses a grid layout (FlowBox) with no view mode functionality implemented. No view mode switcher exists in the UI, no ViewMode enum, no SetViewMode input handling, and no view_mode field in the LibraryPage struct. The preferences page also has no view mode settings. The library is already displaying correctly in grid layout only, meeting all acceptance criteria.
