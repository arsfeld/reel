## Description

Merge src/platforms/relm4/styles/ and src/styles/ into a single unified styles directory to eliminate duplication and create consistency across the application.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 Analyze content of both styles directories
- [x] #2 Merge all styles into src/styles/
- [x] #3 Remove duplicate style definitions
- [x] #4 Update all style imports in the codebase
- [x] #5 Verify UI appearance remains consistent
<!-- AC:END -->


## Implementation Plan

1. Analyze content of both styles directories
2. Check for any existing src/styles directory
3. Move all CSS files to src/styles/
4. Update all include_str! references in code
5. Remove old styles directories
6. Build and verify appearance


## Implementation Notes

Successfully consolidated all styles into a single src/styles/ directory.

Changes made:
- Moved all CSS files from src/platforms/relm4/styles/ to src/styles/
  - details.css
  - player.css
  - sidebar.css
- Updated all include_str! references:
  - src/ui/pages/player.rs: Updated path to player.css
  - src/platforms/relm4/app.rs: Updated paths to details.css and sidebar.css
- Removed empty src/platforms/relm4/styles/ directory

The build completes successfully and all CSS files are now centralized in src/styles/.
