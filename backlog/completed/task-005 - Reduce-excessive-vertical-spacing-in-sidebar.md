## Description

The sidebar has excessive vertical spacing between items. Previous attempts to fix this have altered the wrong spacing values. The issue is likely in the ListBox items themselves or the factory components, not the container spacing. Need to find where the actual vertical padding/margins are set for each sidebar item.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 Vertical spacing between sidebar items is reduced for a more compact layout
- [x] #2 Sidebar maintains visual hierarchy while being more space-efficient
- [x] #3 All sidebar content remains accessible and clickable with reduced spacing
- [x] #4 Spacing adjustments work well with both light and dark themes
<!-- AC:END -->


## Implementation Plan

1. Analyze current spacing values in sidebar component\n2. Identify areas with excessive vertical spacing\n3. Reduce spacing between navigation items while maintaining usability\n4. Reduce spacing between source/library entries\n5. Test layout remains functional and visually balanced


## Implementation Notes

Reduced excessive vertical spacing throughout the sidebar component by changing spacing values from 8/12/24 to 4/8/16, reduced margins from 6/8/12 to 4/6/8, and tightened spacing in source groups and status areas. This makes the sidebar more compact while maintaining readability.

\n\nFixed successfully - systematically reduced all spacing values: main 8→4, welcome 24→16, sources 12→8, margins 6/8→4/6.

\n\nSpacing still excessive. Previous fixes altered wrong values. Need to check ListBox item spacing and factory component margins.

Issue identified: Library buttons are too large vertically, causing excessive spacing between sidebar items.

Fixed: Reduced vertical margins from 4px to 2px for library buttons, changed spacing in vertical boxes from 2px to 0px, changed font size from "heading" class to "body" class for both library names and Home button to create more compact, consistent layout.
