## Description

Episodes are not being synced to the database during the sync process. While the episode display functionality is now working, there are no episodes in the database to display. The sync process needs to be fixed to properly fetch and store episodes from both Plex and Jellyfin backends.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 Investigate why episodes are not being synced during library sync
- [x] #2 Check if sync_show_episodes is being called correctly
- [x] #3 Verify backend get_episodes methods are returning data
- [x] #4 Fix episode storage in database during sync
- [ ] #5 Test episode sync with Plex backend
- [ ] #6 Test episode sync with Jellyfin backend
- [ ] #7 Verify episodes appear in database after sync
- [ ] #8 Ensure episodes display in UI after successful sync
<!-- AC:END -->


## Implementation Plan

1. Investigate sync_show_episodes implementation
2. Identify root cause (seasons data not available from DB)
3. Add get_seasons method to MediaBackend trait
4. Implement get_seasons in all backends
5. Fix sync_show_episodes to use backend API
6. Test and verify fix

Key observation: All shows are returning 0 episodes during sync, indicating the backend get_episodes methods are not returning any data.


## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was that sync_show_episodes was trying to fetch show data from the database to get seasons, but the show had just been synced and didn't have complete season information populated. The function was iterating through an empty seasons array, resulting in 0 episodes being synced.\n\n## Solution Implemented\n\n1. Added `get_seasons` method to the MediaBackend trait to fetch seasons directly from backend APIs\n2. Implemented `get_seasons` in all three backends (Plex, Jellyfin, Local)\n3. Modified `sync_show_episodes` to fetch seasons from the backend API instead of relying on database data\n4. Updated imports across all backend implementations to include the Season model\n\n## Changes Made\n\n- `src/backends/traits.rs`: Added `get_seasons` method to MediaBackend trait\n- `src/backends/plex/mod.rs`: Implemented `get_seasons` method and added Season import\n- `src/backends/jellyfin/mod.rs`: Implemented `get_seasons` method and added Season import  \n- `src/backends/local/mod.rs`: Added stub implementation for `get_seasons` method and Season import\n- `src/services/core/sync.rs`: Refactored `sync_show_episodes` to call backend.get_seasons() directly\n\n## Impact\n\nThis fix ensures that episodes are properly synced during the initial sync process by fetching season information directly from the backend APIs rather than relying on incomplete database state.
