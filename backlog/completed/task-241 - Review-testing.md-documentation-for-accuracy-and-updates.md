## Description

Review the testing documentation to ensure it accurately describes the current testing approach, tools, and best practices

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 Verify test framework documentation is current
- [x] #2 Check unit testing patterns and examples
- [x] #3 Validate integration testing documentation
- [x] #4 Confirm mock and fixture documentation
- [x] #5 Update CI/CD testing pipeline documentation
- [x] #6 Document any missing test coverage areas
<!-- AC:END -->


## Implementation Notes

Reviewed and updated docs/testing.md documentation to accurately reflect the current state of testing in the Reel project.

Key changes made:
1. Updated overview to focus on practical testing approach rather than theoretical comprehensive strategy
2. Corrected test framework documentation - removed non-existent Relm4 component tests
3. Updated unit test examples to show actual Plex/Jellyfin backend tests with mockito
4. Removed tracker pattern, factory component, and command tests that don't exist
5. Updated integration test examples to reflect actual sync strategy tests
6. Removed UI automation and performance test sections (not implemented)
7. Updated test infrastructure to show actual test_utils.rs implementation
8. Corrected CI/CD documentation to match GitHub Actions workflow
9. Simplified test organization to show actual file structure
10. Added 'Areas Needing Test Coverage' section documenting gaps:
   - UI Components lack tests
   - Service layer needs coverage
   - Command pattern untested
   - MessageBroker communication untested
   - Player backends lack tests
   - Auth flow needs testing
11. Added practical testing priorities and best practices

The documentation now accurately describes the current testing implementation which focuses on backend API mocking, database repository testing, and mapper tests, while clearly identifying areas that need additional test coverage.
