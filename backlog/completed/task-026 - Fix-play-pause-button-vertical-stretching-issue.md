## Description

The play/pause button in the player controls is still showing vertical stretching despite CSS fixes. The button should be perfectly circular but appears stretched vertically. Need to investigate alternative approaches to ensure the button maintains a 1:1 aspect ratio.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 Investigate why current CSS rules are not working
- [x] #2 Try using a container wrapper approach
- [x] #3 Consider using fixed-size SVG icons
- [x] #4 Test with different GTK button implementations
- [x] #5 Ensure button is perfectly circular in all states
<!-- AC:END -->


## Implementation Plan

1. Locate the player controls and play/pause button implementation
2. Analyze current CSS rules and why they might not be working
3. Test with a container wrapper approach to force aspect ratio
4. Try using fixed-size approach with explicit width/height
5. Consider alternative GTK button implementations if needed
6. Test the solution in different player states and window sizes


## Implementation Notes

## Fix Applied

Fixed the play/pause button vertical stretching issue by:

1. **Container Wrapper Approach**: Wrapped the play/pause button in a gtk::Box container with fixed dimensions (40x40) to enforce square aspect ratio

2. **Dedicated CSS Classes**: Created specific CSS classes for the play/pause button:
   - `.play-pause-container`: Forces 40x40 dimensions on the wrapper
   - `.play-pause-button`: Applies circular styling with explicit width/height and border-radius

3. **CSS Consolidation**: Cleaned up conflicting CSS rules by:
   - Separating play/pause button styles from generic circular button styles
   - Using `:not(.play-pause-button)` selector for other circular buttons
   - Ensuring all dimension properties use !important to override GTK defaults

4. **GTK Properties**: Added `set_can_shrink: false` to prevent the button from being compressed

5. **Icon Sizing**: Set fixed icon dimensions (16x16) to ensure consistent appearance

The button now maintains a perfect 1:1 aspect ratio (circular appearance) in all states including hover and active states.
