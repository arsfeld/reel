## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Execute the test suite to identify all currently failing tests and categorize the failures by type and component. This provides a clear baseline of what needs to be fixed before proceeding with actual fixes.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 All tests are executed using cargo test,Test output is captured and analyzed,Failing tests are categorized by component (UI, backend, database, etc.),Each failure has error message and stack trace documented,Test execution summary shows total pass/fail counts
<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Plan

<!-- SECTION:PLAN:BEGIN -->
1. Execute cargo test and capture output
2. Analyze test output for compilation warnings
3. Analyze test execution results
4. Categorize findings by severity and component
5. Document all findings in implementation notes
<!-- SECTION:PLAN:END -->

## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
## Test Execution Summary

✅ **All tests PASSED** - 175 tests executed successfully
- 0 failed tests  
- 0 ignored tests
- Execution time: 30.18 seconds

## Compilation Analysis

### Test Suite Status
- All tests compile successfully
- No test failures detected
- Full test coverage across components:
  - Unit tests: Models, identifiers, cache keys, utilities
  - Integration tests: Database repositories, sync operations
  - Component tests: Workers (ConnectionMonitor, SyncWorker)
  - Backend tests: Plex and Jellyfin mock tests

### Compilation Warnings Summary (87 total)
While tests pass, there are numerous dead code warnings that should be addressed:

#### By Category:
1. **Unused imports**: 23 warnings
2. **Dead code (never used)**: 64 warnings
   - Methods: 45
   - Structs/Enums/Traits: 8
   - Functions: 7
   - Fields: 4

#### By Component:
- **Services** (commands, core): 20 warnings
- **Backends** (Plex, Jellyfin, traits): 15 warnings
- **Database** (entities, repositories): 25 warnings
- **Models**: 12 warnings
- **Config**: 10 warnings
- **Other** (mapper, player, workers): 5 warnings

## Test Categories Verified

### ✅ Unit Tests (Models & Core)
- Identifier types (BackendId, LibraryId, MediaItemId, etc.)
- Cache key generation and parsing
- Command execution patterns
- Media service core functionality

### ✅ Integration Tests (Database)
- Sync repository CRUD operations
- Repository trait implementations
- Database lifecycle management
- Multi-source handling

### ✅ Component Tests (Workers)
- SyncWorker: Auto-sync, intervals, cancellation
- ConnectionMonitor: Health checks, status reporting, reconnection

### ✅ Backend Tests
- Plex: Authentication mocks, connection timeout
- Jellyfin: Authentication mocks, connection timeout

## Key Findings

1. **No failing tests** - The test suite is fully functional
2. **Good test coverage** - All major components have test coverage
3. **Dead code issue** - Significant amount of unused code (87 warnings)
4. **Test infrastructure solid** - Test utilities and mocking frameworks working well

## Recommendations

1. Dead code cleanup would improve compilation speed and reduce warnings
2. Consider adding tests for currently untested components (UI components, some services)
3. Integration tests between components could be expanded
