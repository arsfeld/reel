## Description

Review the services architecture documentation to ensure it accurately describes the current service layer implementation

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Verify service initialization flow is accurate
- [ ] #2 Check broker pattern implementations
- [ ] #3 Validate command pattern documentation
- [ ] #4 Confirm repository layer integration
- [ ] #5 Update service type definitions
- [ ] #6 Verify cache strategy documentation
<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Notes

Reviewed and updated services.md documentation to accurately reflect the current implementation. Major updates included:

- Corrected file paths to match actual code structure (e.g., identifiers in src/models/ not src/services/types/)
- Updated service directory structure to show actual modules and their locations
- Replaced theoretical code examples with real implementations from the codebase
- Added clarity on current architecture status (implemented, partially implemented, known gaps)
- Documented that message brokers currently use logging functions instead of full MessageBroker
- Updated Worker patterns with actual SyncWorkerInput/SyncWorkerOutput types
- Showed the real trait-based Command pattern implementation
- Added migration guidelines for working with the current service architecture

The documentation now serves as an accurate reference for the current state of the services layer, clearly distinguishing between what's implemented and what remains as planned architecture.
