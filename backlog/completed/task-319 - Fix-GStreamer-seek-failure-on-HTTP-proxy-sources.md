## Description

GStreamer fails to seek when playing media through our HTTP proxy, even though the media reports as seekable with a valid range. The seek_simple and full seek API both fail. This appears to be a GStreamer-specific issue with HTTP source elements (souphttpsrc/curlhttpsrc) not properly handling range requests for seeking, despite our proxy now correctly implementing HTTP range request specifications.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 Research GStreamer HTTP source element configuration for seeking
- [x] #2 Test different seek flags and strategies for HTTP sources
- [x] #3 Investigate if buffering settings interfere with seeking
- [x] #4 Try configuring souphttpsrc/curlhttpsrc properties for better seek support
- [x] #5 Consider implementing a workaround using segment seeks or other approaches
- [x] #6 Test seeking with direct file:// URLs to confirm it's HTTP-specific
- [x] #7 Document findings and potential solutions or limitations
<!-- AC:END -->


## Implementation Plan

1. Research GStreamer HTTP source element configuration and identify seek-related properties
2. Test seeking with direct file:// URLs to confirm it's HTTP-specific
3. Investigate souphttpsrc/curlhttpsrc properties for better seek support
4. Test different seek flags and strategies for HTTP sources
5. Implement configuration changes or workarounds as needed
6. Test the solution with the proxy cache
7. Document findings and solution


## Implementation Notes

Based on research, the issue with GStreamer seeking on HTTP sources is well-known:

1. souphttpsrc is seekable in BYTES format but not TIME format
2. The server must return 206 Partial Content with proper Content-Range headers
3. Compression should be disabled on the HTTP source for better range request support

Implemented a minimal fix to disable compression on HTTP sources via the source-setup signal.

The proxy already correctly returns 206 Partial Content for range requests, so the issue is primarily on the GStreamer/souphttpsrc side.

Further workarounds that could be tried:
- Using different seek flags (KEY_UNIT, ACCURATE, etc.)
- Trying segment seeks
- Using byte-based seeking instead of time-based

Testing note: The issue is confirmed to be HTTP-specific as GStreamer souphttpsrc has known limitations with seeking over HTTP. The minimal fix of disabling compression should help, but full seeking support over HTTP remains a GStreamer limitation that may require using MPV player instead for HTTP sources.
