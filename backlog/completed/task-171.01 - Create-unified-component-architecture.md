## Description

After moving components out of the isolated Relm4 directory, establish a clean component architecture that separates UI framework-specific code from business logic.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Define clear boundaries between UI components and business logic
- [ ] #2 Create trait-based abstractions for UI components where needed
- [ ] #3 Ensure Relm4-specific code is properly isolated in implementation files
- [ ] #4 Document the new component architecture
- [ ] #5 Update CLAUDE.md with new structure
<!-- AC:END -->
