## Description

The ConnectionMonitor implementation needs to be tested with actual Plex and Jellyfin servers to ensure it properly detects connection changes, handles reconnections, and updates the UI correctly.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Set up test environment with Plex server
- [ ] #2 Set up test environment with Jellyfin server
- [ ] #3 Test connection loss detection (disconnect network)
- [ ] #4 Test automatic reconnection when network restored
- [ ] #5 Test connection quality changes (local to remote)
- [ ] #6 Verify UI updates correctly for all connection states
- [ ] #7 Test with multiple simultaneous backend connections
<!-- AC:END -->
