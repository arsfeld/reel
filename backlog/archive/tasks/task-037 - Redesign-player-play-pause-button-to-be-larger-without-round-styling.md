## Description

The current play/pause button in the player uses a round/circular styling that doesn't fit well with the overall design. Instead of the round button, the play/pause button should be larger than the surrounding controls (previous, next, etc.) to emphasize its importance as the primary action, while maintaining consistent styling with other buttons.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Remove round/circular styling from play/pause button
- [ ] #2 Increase play/pause button size relative to other player controls
- [ ] #3 Maintain consistent button styling with other player controls
- [ ] #4 Ensure proper visual hierarchy with play/pause as the primary action
- [ ] #5 Test button appearance in both playing and paused states
<!-- AC:END -->
