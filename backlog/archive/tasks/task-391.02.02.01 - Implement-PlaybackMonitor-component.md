## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Create PlaybackMonitor to track player health, detect buffering events, measure buffer duration, and determine playback stability. This component monitors player state transitions and provides health metrics.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 PlaybackMonitor listens to player state changes (playing, buffering, error)
- [ ] #2 Buffer events are recorded with timestamp and duration
- [ ] #3 Buffer history maintains 60-second rolling window
- [ ] #4 PlaybackHealth enum reflects current state (Healthy, Buffering, Unstable, Failed)
- [ ] #5 PlaybackMetrics are emitted via channel for AdaptiveQualityManager
- [ ] #6 Detects frequent buffering (3+ buffers in 60s = Unstable)
<!-- AC:END -->
