## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Create AdaptiveQualityManager to analyze playback and bandwidth metrics, apply quality adjustment algorithms, and trigger quality changes. This is the core decision-making component for adaptive streaming.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Receives metrics from PlaybackMonitor and BandwidthMonitor
- [ ] #2 Implements quality adjustment algorithm with decision matrix
- [ ] #3 Emergency recovery: drops 2 levels or to lowest on playback failure
- [ ] #4 Progressive decrease: drops 1 level on unstable playback or insufficient bandwidth
- [ ] #5 Progressive increase: raises 1 level when bandwidth has 20% headroom and playback is healthy
- [ ] #6 Cooldown period between quality changes (10 seconds default)
- [ ] #7 Supports Auto and Manual modes (Manual disables automatic changes)
- [ ] #8 Emits QualityDecision events for PlayerController to execute
