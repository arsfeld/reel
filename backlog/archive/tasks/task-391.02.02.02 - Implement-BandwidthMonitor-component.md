## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Create BandwidthMonitor to track chunk download speeds, calculate moving averages, detect bandwidth trends, and estimate available bandwidth for quality decisions.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Records chunk download times and calculates bytes per second
- [ ] #2 Maintains 30-second rolling window of speed measurements
- [ ] #3 Calculates current speed and moving average speed
- [ ] #4 Detects bandwidth trend (Increasing, Stable, Decreasing)
- [ ] #5 Provides conservative bandwidth estimate (80% of average)
- [ ] #6 BandwidthMetrics are emitted via channel for AdaptiveQualityManager
- [ ] #7 Integrated with CacheProxy to receive chunk download notifications
