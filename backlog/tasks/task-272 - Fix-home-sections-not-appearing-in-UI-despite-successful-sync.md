## Description

Home sections are successfully synced (6 sections saved) but they don't appear in the UI. The sections are saved to the database but most media items are skipped because they reference episodes/shows that aren't in the database yet. The home page loads but shows no sections.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 Investigate why synced home sections don't appear in the UI
- [x] #2 Check if the UI is properly loading sections from HomeSectionRepository
- [x] #3 Fix the media item ID mismatch (episodes vs shows)
- [ ] #4 Ensure home sections display even with partial media items
- [ ] #5 Test that home sections appear after sync completes
<!-- AC:END -->


## Implementation Plan

1. Modify sync_worker to include episodes/shows that are not in database yet
2. Update HomeSectionRepository to return all section items regardless of media existence
3. Change UI to handle missing media gracefully
4. Test that sections display with partial content


## Implementation Notes

Found the issue: Episodes are being synced but with season_number=0 for all episodes. The missing episodes are from newer seasons (S2, S4, S5) that don't exist in our database. The sync process is not properly fetching or storing season information, causing all episodes to be stored with season_number=0.

Root cause identified: This is caused by task-273 - all episodes are stored with season_number=0. Once task-273 is fixed, home sections will display correctly as the missing episodes will be properly synced with correct season numbers.
