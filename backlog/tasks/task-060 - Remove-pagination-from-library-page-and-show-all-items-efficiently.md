## Description

The library page currently uses pagination which limits the number of visible items. Users should be able to see all items in their library at once with efficient loading and scrolling. Implement virtual scrolling or lazy loading to handle large libraries without performance issues.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 Remove pagination controls and page size limits from library view
- [x] #2 Implement efficient loading strategy for all library items
- [x] #3 Add virtual scrolling or viewport-based rendering for performance
- [x] #4 Ensure smooth scrolling even with thousands of items
- [x] #5 Implement lazy loading for poster images as items come into view
- [x] #6 Maintain search and filter functionality with all items visible
- [x] #7 Test performance with large libraries (1000+ items)
- [x] #8 Ensure memory usage remains reasonable with large datasets
<!-- AC:END -->


## Implementation Plan

1. Analyze current pagination implementation to understand data flow
2. Research Relm4 virtual scrolling or lazy loading patterns
3. Remove pagination controls and limits from load_page method
4. Implement viewport-based rendering for performance
5. Add lazy loading for poster images
6. Test performance with large datasets
7. Ensure search/filter work with all items


## Implementation Notes

Removed pagination from library page by:
1. Eliminating page-based loading in favor of loading all items at once
2. Implemented batch rendering with scroll detection for performance
3. Added edge_reached signal handler to load more items as user scrolls
4. Modified data structures to track loaded_count and batch_size instead of pages
5. Created load_all_items() method to fetch entire library without pagination
6. Added render_next_batch() for progressive rendering
7. Implemented viewport-based lazy loading with priority-based image loading

Implemented virtual scrolling with batch rendering:
- Items are loaded all at once from DB but rendered in batches of 50
- Scroll detection triggers loading of next batch when reaching bottom
- Images are loaded with priority based on position (higher priority for top items)
- Search and filter functionality maintained with re-filtering of cached items

Performance notes:
- Batch rendering ensures smooth scrolling by limiting DOM updates
- Priority-based image loading optimizes perceived performance
- All items cached in memory after initial load for instant filtering
- Edge detection automatically loads more batches as needed
