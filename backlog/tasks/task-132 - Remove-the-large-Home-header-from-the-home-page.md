## Description

The home page currently displays a large 'Home' header that takes up unnecessary space and doesn't add value to the user experience. This header should be removed to provide more room for content and create a cleaner interface.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 Large Home header is completely removed from the home page
- [x] #2 Page layout adjusts properly after header removal
- [x] #3 No visual artifacts or spacing issues after removal
<!-- AC:END -->


## Implementation Plan

1. Locate the Home header in the home.rs component
2. Remove the header Box container and its Label
3. Adjust the main container margins if needed
4. Test that the layout renders properly without the header

## Implementation Notes

Removed the large "Home" header from the home page component.

Changes made:
- Removed the header gtk::Box container and its Label widget from lines 96-108 in src/platforms/relm4/components/pages/home.rs
- Adjusted the sections_container top margin by removing the explicit set_margin_top: 0 override, allowing the default margin from set_margin_all: 24 to apply uniformly

The layout now displays content directly without the unnecessary header, providing more screen real estate for the home page sections.
