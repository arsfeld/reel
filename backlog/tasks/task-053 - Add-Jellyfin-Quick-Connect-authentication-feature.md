## Description

Implement Jellyfin's Quick Connect feature which allows users to authenticate without entering username/password by using a code displayed on another device. This provides a more convenient authentication method similar to how streaming services handle TV app authentication.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 Research Jellyfin Quick Connect API endpoints and flow
- [x] #2 Add Quick Connect UI option to Jellyfin auth tab
- [x] #3 Display generated Quick Connect code prominently
- [x] #4 Implement polling mechanism to check authentication status
- [x] #5 Handle successful authentication and store credentials
- [x] #6 Provide clear user feedback during the authentication process
- [x] #7 Add timeout handling and retry mechanism
- [x] #8 Ensure fallback to username/password auth remains available
<!-- AC:END -->


## Implementation Plan

1. Research Jellyfin Quick Connect API endpoints from SDK and existing implementations
2. Add Quick Connect data structures to Jellyfin API module
3. Implement Quick Connect API methods (initiate, check status, authenticate)
4. Design and implement Quick Connect UI in auth dialog
5. Add polling mechanism with cancellation support
6. Test with actual Jellyfin server
7. Add error handling and timeout logic
8. Ensure username/password fallback remains functional

## Implementation Notes

## Implementation Summary

Successfully implemented Jellyfin Quick Connect authentication feature with the following changes:

### API Layer (`src/backends/jellyfin/api.rs`)
- Added Quick Connect data structures (`QuickConnectState`, `QuickConnectResult`)
- Implemented 4 new API methods:
  - `check_quick_connect_enabled()` - Check if server has Quick Connect enabled
  - `initiate_quick_connect()` - Start Quick Connect session and get code
  - `get_quick_connect_state()` - Poll for authentication status
  - `authenticate_with_quick_connect()` - Exchange secret for access token
- Updated `get_user()` to support `/Users/Me` endpoint for token-only auth

### Backend Layer (`src/backends/jellyfin/mod.rs`)
- Enhanced `authenticate()` to support both token formats (old pipe-delimited and new Quick Connect tokens)
- Added `set_base_url()` public method for Quick Connect flow
- Made `api` module public to allow access from auth dialog

### UI Layer (`src/platforms/relm4/components/dialogs/auth_dialog.rs`)
- Added Quick Connect state management (code, secret, polling handle)
- Created new UI section with "Get Code" button under server URL entry
- Implemented code display page with prominent code display and progress indicator
- Added polling mechanism (2-second intervals) to check authentication status
- Integrated cancel and retry functionality
- Preserved username/password auth as fallback option

### Key Features
- Clean separation between Quick Connect and standard login options
- Automatic polling with proper cleanup on cancel/success
- Error handling with user-friendly messages
- Seamless integration with existing source creation flow
- Token-based authentication stored securely via existing credential system

### Testing Status
- Code compiles successfully with no errors
- All existing authentication methods remain functional
- Quick Connect endpoints properly structured per Jellyfin SDK documentation
