## Description

Review the backend flow documentation to ensure it accurately reflects the current implementation and is up-to-date with recent changes

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 Verify MediaBackend trait interface matches current implementation
- [x] #2 Check backend initialization flow accuracy
- [x] #3 Validate Plex backend implementation details
- [x] #4 Validate Jellyfin backend implementation details
- [x] #5 Confirm local backend status and documentation accuracy
- [x] #6 Update any outdated code examples or API references
<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Notes

Reviewed and updated backend-flow.md documentation. Found that ConnectionMonitor is actually integrated in MainWindow with periodic 10-second health checks. Corrected several inaccuracies including connection monitor integration status, line number references for backend code, and added Known Limitations section documenting the actual state of Local backend (10% complete), Jellyfin limitations, and Plex cast/crew extraction gaps. Documentation now accurately reflects the current implementation.
