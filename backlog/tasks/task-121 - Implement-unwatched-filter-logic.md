## Description

Create the filtering logic to show only unwatched content when the Unwatched tab is selected, using existing playback_progress data

- [ ] #4 Filter performance is optimized for large libraries (10k+ items)
- [ ] #5 Filter integrates with existing repository layer
- [ ] #6 Filter respects user-specific watch status per source
