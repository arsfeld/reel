## Description

Create a centralized configuration service that loads config once at application startup and provides shared read access across all components. This will eliminate redundant file I/O and ensure configuration consistency.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Design configuration service architecture with read/write synchronization
- [ ] #2 Implement singleton configuration service
- [ ] #3 Load configuration once at app startup
- [ ] #4 Provide thread-safe read access to all components
- [ ] #5 Implement write synchronization for config updates
- [ ] #6 Replace component-level Config::load() calls with service access
- [ ] #7 Add tests for configuration service
<!-- AC:END -->
