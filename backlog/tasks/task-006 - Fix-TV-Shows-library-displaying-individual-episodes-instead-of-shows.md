## Description

The TV Shows library page incorrectly displays individual episodes as separate items instead of grouping them by TV show. Users should see TV show cards that they can click to view seasons and episodes, not a flat list of all episodes.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 TV Shows library displays show-level cards, not individual episodes
- [ ] #2 Each TV show card shows poster, title, and show metadata
- [ ] #3 Clicking a TV show navigates to show details page with seasons/episodes
- [ ] #4 Library correctly filters to show only TV show entities from the database
<!-- AC:END -->
