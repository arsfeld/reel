## Description

Current reconnection logic uses a simple 5-second retry. Should implement exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, etc.) with maximum retry limits to avoid overwhelming servers during extended outages.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Implement exponential backoff algorithm in ConnectionMonitor
- [ ] #2 Track retry attempts per source
- [ ] #3 Set maximum retry delay (e.g., 5 minutes)
- [ ] #4 Reset retry count on successful connection
- [ ] #5 Add configuration for retry parameters (initial delay, multiplier, max delay)
- [ ] #6 Log retry attempts and delays for debugging
<!-- AC:END -->
