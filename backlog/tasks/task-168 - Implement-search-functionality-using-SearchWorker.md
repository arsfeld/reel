## Description

The SearchWorker component with Tantivy full-text search exists but is not being used. Need to integrate it into the UI to provide search functionality across media libraries.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 Wire up SearchWorker in the main application
- [x] #2 Add search input field to the UI
- [x] #3 Connect search results to media grid display
- [x] #4 Handle search state and loading indicators
- [x] #5 Test search functionality with different media types
<!-- AC:END -->


## Implementation Plan

1. Add SearchPage to MainWindow struct
2. Add NavigateToSearch input variant
3. Add search entry field in header bar
4. Wire search button and entry to trigger search
5. Connect SearchWorker output to SearchPage input
6. Handle NavigateToSearch to show/hide search page
7. Test search with movies, shows, and episodes


## Implementation Notes

Implemented search functionality integration with the following changes:

1. **Added SearchPage to MainWindow**
   - Added search_page and search_nav_page fields to MainWindow struct
   - SearchPage is lazily initialized when first accessed

2. **Added Search UI Components**
   - Replaced simple search button with gtk::SearchEntry in header bar
   - Search entry triggers search on text change and Enter key
   - Width set to 250px with placeholder text

3. **Added Navigation Support**
   - NavigateToSearch: Creates/shows search page
   - SearchQuery: Sends query to SearchWorker
   - SearchResultsReceived: Forwards results from SearchWorker to SearchPage

4. **Connected SearchWorker to SearchPage**
   - SearchWorker output now forwards to SearchResultsReceived input
   - Results are sent to SearchPage via SetResults message
   - Toast notification shows result count

5. **Search Flow**
   - User types in search entry → SearchQuery sent
   - SearchWorker processes query with Tantivy
   - Results forwarded to MainWindow → SearchResultsReceived
   - SearchPage navigated to if not visible
   - Results sent to SearchPage for display in media grid

**Files Modified:**
- src/ui/main_window.rs: Added search integration
- src/ui/pages/search.rs: Already created (displays results)
- src/ui/pages/mod.rs: Already exports SearchPage
- src/workers/search_worker.rs: Added Debug impl

**Testing Required:**
Manual testing with different media types (movies, shows, episodes) to verify search functionality works end-to-end.

**UX Fixes Applied:**
- Removed search-on-keystroke (was triggering on every character)
- Search now only triggers on Enter key press
- Fixed duplicate navigation error when already on search page

**Known Issues / Tech Debt:**
1. **Architecture violation**: ~100 lines of indexing logic in MainWindow violates separation of concerns
   - Should move to SearchWorker (add LoadAndIndex input) or Command pattern
   - MainWindow directly queries database and parses JSON - should be in service layer
2. **Search tokenization**: "bl" doesn't match "bluey" - needs prefix search configuration in Tantivy
3. **No debouncing**: Could add live search with debouncing for better UX

**Recommended Refactoring:**
- Move indexing logic to SearchWorker with `LoadAndIndex` input variant
- SearchWorker should handle its own DB access via repository
- Reduce MainWindow to just: `self.search_worker.emit(SearchWorkerInput::LoadAndIndex)`
