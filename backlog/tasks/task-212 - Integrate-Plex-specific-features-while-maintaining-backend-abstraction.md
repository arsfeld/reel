## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
After implementing the new Plex API endpoints (PlayQueue, Search, Sessions, Transcoding), analyze how to properly integrate these features into the application architecture. This involves balancing Plex-specific functionality with the abstract MediaBackend trait that supports multiple backends (Jellyfin, Local).

The task should address:
1. How to expose Plex-specific features without breaking the backend abstraction
2. Optional trait methods or feature detection for backend-specific capabilities
3. Proper integration points in the UI for Plex-enhanced features
4. Fallback strategies when features aren't available in other backends
5. Maintaining clean separation between backend-agnostic and backend-specific code
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 MediaBackend trait has been analyzed for optional capability extension patterns
- [ ] #2 Feature capability detection system has been designed and documented
- [ ] #3 UI integration patterns for backend-specific features are documented
- [ ] #4 Fallback strategies for missing features in other backends are implemented
- [ ] #5 Clean architecture separation between backend-agnostic and backend-specific code is maintained
- [ ] #6 Architecture documentation is updated with integration patterns
