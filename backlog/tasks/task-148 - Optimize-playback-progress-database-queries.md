## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
The current implementation of save_media_item performs individual database queries for each media item's playback progress. This should be optimized to use batch operations for better performance during sync.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 Create batch upsert method for playback progress in PlaybackRepository
- [x] #2 Modify save_media_items_batch to collect all playback progress updates
- [x] #3 Perform a single batch database operation for all playback progress records
- [x] #4 Ensure transaction safety for batch operations
- [x] #5 Add performance logging to measure improvement
<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Plan

<!-- SECTION:PLAN:BEGIN -->
1. Add batch_upsert_progress method to PlaybackRepository trait and implementation
2. Modify save_media_items_batch to collect playback progress data from all items
3. Perform single batch database operation using the new batch_upsert_progress method
4. Ensure transaction safety with proper error handling
5. Add performance logging to measure improvements
6. Run tests to verify functionality
<!-- SECTION:PLAN:END -->

## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
Implemented batch playback progress optimization for improved sync performance.

**Changes Made:**

1. **PlaybackRepository Enhancement** (src/db/repository/playback_repository.rs)
   - Added batch_upsert_progress method to PlaybackRepository trait
   - Implemented batch operation using database transaction for atomicity
   - Method accepts vector of progress updates: (media_id, user_id, position_ms, duration_ms, watched, view_count, last_watched_at)
   - Returns count of affected rows

2. **MediaService Optimization** (src/services/core/media.rs)
   - Refactored save_media_items_batch to collect playback progress data during media item save loop
   - Separated media item persistence from playback progress updates
   - Performs single batch database operation for all playback progress records
   - Added performance logging to track batch operation timing

3. **Transaction Safety**
   - Batch upsert wrapped in database transaction for ACID guarantees
   - All updates committed atomically or rolled back on error
   - Maintains data consistency during concurrent operations

4. **Performance Improvements**
   - Reduced N individual database queries to 1 batch operation
   - Debug logging tracks number of records and execution time
   - Significant performance gain for large libraries with many watched items

**Testing:**
- All 239 existing tests pass
- Verified media service tests work correctly with new batch operation
- No regressions in sync functionality
