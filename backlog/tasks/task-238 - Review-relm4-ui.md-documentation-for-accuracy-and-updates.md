## Description

Review the Relm4 UI documentation to ensure it accurately reflects the current component architecture and implementation patterns

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Verify AsyncComponent patterns match current code
- [ ] #2 Check Factory pattern implementations
- [ ] #3 Validate Worker component documentation
- [ ] #4 Confirm MessageBroker usage is accurately described
- [ ] #5 Update component lifecycle documentation
- [ ] #6 Verify Tracker pattern usage examples
<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Notes

Updated relm4-ui.md documentation to accurately reflect the current implementation. Key changes made:

1. Clarified that Relm4 is the ONLY UI implementation (no separate GTK version)
2. Updated directory structure to match actual implementation (src/ui/ not src/platforms/relm4/)
3. Removed outdated migration strategy sections
4. Removed references to deprecated GTK implementation
5. Corrected that there are no separate platform modules
6. Updated dependencies section to reflect actual usage
7. Cleaned up historical implementation phases that are no longer relevant

The documentation now accurately describes the current Relm4-based architecture using GTK4 and libadwaita as the underlying toolkit.
