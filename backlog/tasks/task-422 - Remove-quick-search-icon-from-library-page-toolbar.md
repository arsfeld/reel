## Description

The search button icon in the library toolbar is awkward, barely works, and doesn't look good. Remove it to simplify the toolbar and improve the UI. Users can still search using the slash key (/) which opens the floating search overlay.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Search button icon removed from library toolbar
- [ ] #2 Slash key (/) shortcut still works to open floating search
- [ ] #3 UI looks cleaner without the awkward search button
<!-- AC:END -->
