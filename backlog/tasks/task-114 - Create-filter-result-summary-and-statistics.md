## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Display a summary of filtered results including item count, aggregate statistics, and active filters. Helps users understand their filtered view at a glance.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 Create FilterSummary component showing result count
- [x] #2 Calculate and display aggregate stats (avg rating, year range)
- [x] #3 Show list of active filters with remove buttons
- [x] #4 Add 'No results found' state with filter suggestions
- [x] #5 Display filter summary above media grid
<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Plan

<!-- SECTION:PLAN:BEGIN -->
1. Review existing filter state and structure in library.rs
2. Add helper methods to calculate filter statistics (count, avg rating, year range)
3. Add method to get list of active filters
4. Design and implement FilterSummary UI component in the view
5. Add filter summary display above media grid with result count
6. Add aggregate statistics display (avg rating, year range from filtered items)
7. Add active filters list with remove buttons
8. Add 'No results found' state with filter suggestions
9. Test all acceptance criteria and verify UI

## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
## Implementation Summary

Added comprehensive filter summary and statistics display to the library page, positioned above the media grid.

## Changes Made

### Data Structures (lines 146-171)
- Added `FilterStatistics` struct to hold aggregate data (count, avg rating, year range)
- Added `ActiveFilter` struct to represent individual filters with labels and types
- Added `ActiveFilterType` enum to identify filter types for removal actions

### Helper Methods (lines 2754-2953)
- `get_filter_statistics()`: Calculates aggregate statistics from filtered items
- `has_active_filters()`: Checks if any filters are currently active
- `get_active_filters_list()`: Returns list of active filters with human-readable labels
- `get_filter_suggestions()`: Provides suggestions when no results are found
- `update_active_filters_display()`: Dynamically creates filter chips with remove buttons

### UI Components (lines 743-866)
- **Result count display**: Shows total filtered items with bold formatting
- **Aggregate statistics**: Displays average rating and year range when available
- **Active filters chips**: Interactive pills with close buttons for each active filter
- **No results state**: Helpful message with suggestions and "Clear All Filters" button

### Filter Removal (lines 1682-1736)
- Added `RemoveFilter` input message handling
- Supports removing individual filters by type (text, genre, year, rating, watch status, tab)
- Updates UI and reloads filtered items after removal

### Integration
- Filter summary updates automatically when filters change (line 1379)
- Summary is visible when filters are active or results are shown
- Positioned above media grid for immediate visibility

## Technical Notes

The filter chips use GTK's "pill" CSS class for visual consistency. The implementation uses dynamic widget creation to handle variable numbers of active filters, with each chip containing a label and close button that sends a RemoveFilter message when clicked.
