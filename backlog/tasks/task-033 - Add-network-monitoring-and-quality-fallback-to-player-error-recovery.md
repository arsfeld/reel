## Description

Enhance the player error recovery system with advanced features for network connectivity monitoring and automatic quality stream fallback when high quality streams fail.

- [ ] #3 Add network reconnection detection to automatically retry after connectivity is restored
- [ ] #4 Store quality preferences and attempt lower quality streams on repeated failures
- [ ] #5 Add user preference for automatic quality downgrade vs manual selection
<!-- AC:END -->
