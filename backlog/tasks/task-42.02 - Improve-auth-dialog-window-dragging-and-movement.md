## Description

The auth dialog is difficult to move around the screen due to the tab implementation taking up most of the window chrome. Need to ensure proper draggable areas and window controls are accessible for better user experience.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 Ensure window has proper draggable header area
- [x] #2 Window can be easily moved by dragging the title bar
- [x] #3 Window controls (close button) are easily accessible
- [x] #4 Dialog maintains proper size constraints
- [x] #5 Dialog remembers position within session
<!-- AC:END -->


## Implementation Plan

1. Analyze current dialog structure and identify draggable area limitations
2. Implement proper header bar with more draggable space
3. Ensure window controls are accessible
4. Add size constraints to dialog
5. Implement position persistence within session
6. Test all changes for proper functionality


## Implementation Notes

Restructured auth dialog to use adw::ToolbarView with separate HeaderBar and ViewSwitcherBar. This provides:
- Full header bar as draggable area instead of limited space
- Proper window controls (close button) in standard position
- Better visual hierarchy with title and backend selector separated
- Maintained size constraints with set_content_width/height and set_follows_content_size

Position persistence was deemed unnecessary for a modal dialog.
