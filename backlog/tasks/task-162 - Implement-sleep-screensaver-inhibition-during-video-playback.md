## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
The system should prevent sleep mode and screensaver activation while a video is actively playing. This ensures uninterrupted viewing experience. The inhibition should only be active during playback and should be released when the video is paused, stopped, or the player is closed.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 Implement sleep inhibition when video playback starts
- [x] #2 Release sleep inhibition when video is paused
- [x] #3 Release sleep inhibition when video is stopped
- [x] #4 Release sleep inhibition when player window is closed
- [x] #5 Use GTK/GNOME inhibit API for proper system integration
- [x] #6 Handle inhibition state correctly when switching between videos
- [x] #7 Ensure inhibition works on both X11 and Wayland
- [ ] #8 Test that system does not sleep during video playback
- [ ] #9 Test that system can sleep again after playback stops
<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Plan

<!-- SECTION:PLAN:BEGIN -->
1. Add inhibit_cookie field to PlayerPage struct (Option<u32>)
2. Create helper methods in PlayerPage:
   - setup_sleep_inhibition() - inhibit sleep when playback starts
   - release_sleep_inhibition() - uninhibit sleep when playback stops/pauses
3. Get GTK Application from self.window.application()
4. Use ApplicationInhibitFlags::IDLE | ApplicationInhibitFlags::SUSPEND
5. Hook into player state changes:
   - Call setup_sleep_inhibition() after successful Play
   - Call release_sleep_inhibition() on Pause/Stop
   - Call release_sleep_inhibition() in component shutdown/drop
6. Test with: cargo build && cargo run

## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
Implemented sleep/screensaver inhibition during video playback using GTK4 Application inhibit API.

Implementation:
1. Added inhibit_cookie field to PlayerPage struct to track inhibition state
2. Created setup_sleep_inhibition() helper method that:
   - Gets GTK Application from window.application()
   - Calls inhibit() with IDLE | SUSPEND flags to prevent both screensaver and system sleep
   - Stores the returned cookie for later cleanup
   - Only activates if not already inhibited (prevents duplicate inhibits)
3. Created release_sleep_inhibition() helper method that:
   - Calls uninhibit(cookie) to release the inhibition
   - Clears the stored cookie
4. Hooked into player state changes in update_cmd():
   - Calls setup_sleep_inhibition() when state becomes Playing
   - Calls release_sleep_inhibition() when state becomes Paused, Stopped, or Error
5. Added cleanup in shutdown() method to ensure inhibition is released when player closes

The implementation uses GTK4's built-in inhibit API which:\n- Works on both X11 and Wayland\n- Integrates with GNOME power management\n- Properly handles D-Bus communication with systemd-logind\n- Automatically handles edge cases like system suspend/resume\n\nTested:\n- Build: ✅ Compiles successfully (0 errors)\n- Tests: ✅ All 233 tests pass\n- Manual testing needed to verify actual sleep prevention behavior\n\nModified files:\n- src/ui/pages/player.rs (added inhibit_cookie field, helper methods, state change hooks)
