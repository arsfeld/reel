## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Implement horizontal filter tabs (All, Unwatched, Recently Added, Genres, Years) at the top of library views for quick content filtering without server queries
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 Five filter tabs render horizontally: All, Unwatched, Recently Added, Genres, Years
- [x] #2 All tab shows complete library content (default state)
- [x] #3 Unwatched tab filters to show only unwatched content
- [x] #4 Recently Added tab shows content from last 30 days
- [x] #5 Genres and Years tabs show placeholder UI for future implementation
- [ ] #6 Selected tab state persists per library in user preferences
- [x] #7 Tab switching is instant (<100ms) using cached data
- [x] #8 Tabs work in combination with existing sort options
<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Plan

<!-- SECTION:PLAN:BEGIN -->
1. Add FilterTab enum and state to track selected tab
2. Add tab UI below toolbar in view! macro
3. Add input message handlers for tab changes
4. Update filtering logic to apply tab-based filters
5. Test tab switching performance (<100ms requirement)
6. Verify tabs work with existing sort options
<!-- SECTION:PLAN:END -->

## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
Implemented predefined filter tabs for library view with the following changes:

1. Added FilterTab enum (All, Unwatched, RecentlyAdded, Genres, Years) to track tab state
2. Added horizontal toggle buttons UI below the toolbar with linked styling
3. Implemented tab-specific filtering logic:
   - All: Shows complete library (default)
   - Unwatched: Sets watch_status_filter to Unwatched
   - Recently Added: Filters items added within last 30 days using added_at field
   - Genres/Years: Opens filter panel as placeholder UI
4. Tab switching is instant (<100ms) as it uses cached total_items data
5. Tabs work with existing sort options and other filters

Note: AC #6 (tab state persistence per library) was not implemented as it requires preferences/config storage infrastructure. Selected tab resets when changing libraries.
