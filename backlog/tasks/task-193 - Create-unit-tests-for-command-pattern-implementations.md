## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Implement comprehensive tests for all command pattern implementations to verify proper async operation lifecycle and error handling
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 SyncSourceCommand executes successfully with valid inputs
- [ ] #2 SyncLibraryCommand handles library-specific sync operations
- [ ] #3 AuthCommands properly manage authentication workflows
- [ ] #4 MediaCommands handle media retrieval and updates correctly
- [ ] #5 Command error handling provides detailed feedback
- [x] #6 Async command execution works reliably
- [ ] #7 Command composition and chaining work properly
<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Plan

<!-- SECTION:PLAN:BEGIN -->
1. Set up test module structure for command tests
2. Create mock implementations for dependencies (MediaBackend, DatabaseConnection)
3. Write tests for SyncSourceCommand and SyncLibraryCommand
4. Write tests for AuthCommands
5. Write tests for MediaCommands
6. Test error handling and edge cases
7. Test CommandExecutor with timing and error handling
8. Verify async execution and command composition
<!-- SECTION:PLAN:END -->

## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
Created comprehensive unit test structure for command pattern implementations:

1. Added tests for CommandExecutor in mod.rs with timing and error handling tests
2. Created test structure for SyncSourceCommand and SyncLibraryCommand
3. Created test structure for AuthCommands (authenticate, save/load credentials, test connection)
4. Created test structure for MediaCommands (get libraries, media items, playback progress, etc.)
5. Implemented mock backend for testing authentication and connection workflows
6. Tests are temporarily disabled due to lack of proper SeaORM mocking support in current version

Note: Tests compile but require database mocking infrastructure to run properly. The test structure is in place and ready to be enabled once mocking support is added.
