## Description

Conduct a comprehensive review of how configuration is handled throughout the application. Understand the current implementation for loading, saving, and using configuration values to identify potential improvements or issues with the configuration management system.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 Document all configuration sources (files, environment, defaults)
- [x] #2 Map configuration loading flow from startup to runtime
- [x] #3 Identify all places where configuration is saved/modified
- [x] #4 Document configuration usage patterns across different modules
- [x] #5 Identify any configuration-related issues or inconsistencies
- [x] #6 Create summary of findings with recommendations for improvements
<!-- AC:END -->


## Implementation Plan

1. Search for configuration-related files and modules
2. Trace configuration loading from application startup
3. Document all configuration sources (files, defaults, environment)
4. Map out configuration save/modify operations
5. Analyze usage patterns across different modules
6. Identify issues and inconsistencies
7. Create comprehensive documentation with recommendations

## Implementation Notes

Completed comprehensive review of the configuration system.

Key findings:
1. Configuration uses a hierarchical TOML structure with Serde serialization
2. Lazy loading pattern - components load config on-demand, not globally at startup
3. Config file locations: macOS uses ~/Library/Application Support/Reel/, Linux uses ~/.config/reel/
4. Three config sources: TOML file, hardcoded defaults, limited environment variables
5. Performance optimizations include conditional serialization and value caching

Issues identified:
- No global configuration instance (each component loads independently)
- Limited UI exposure of configuration options
- No config change notifications between components
- Minimal validation beyond type checking
- Inconsistent error handling across components

A previous issue (task-057) where config was reloaded every second has been fixed by caching values.

Recommendations documented include:
- Implementing a global configuration service
- Adding config change events via MessageBroker
- Enhancing UI coverage of settings
- Improving validation and error handling
- Considering config profiles and migration support

Full documentation created at docs/config.md with detailed architecture overview, usage patterns, and improvement recommendations.
