## Description

When seeking in cached media on macOS, GStreamer fails with 'got eos and didn't receive a complete header object' because curlhttpsrc doesn't make range requests for seeks within partial cache. Configure curlhttpsrc to use range-based seeking by setting iradio-mode=false in the source-setup callback.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 Configure curlhttpsrc with iradio-mode=false in source-setup signal
- [x] #2 Test that seeking to later positions (>50%) works with partial cache
- [x] #3 Verify MKV Cues section can be accessed during seeks
<!-- AC:END -->


## Implementation Notes

Fixed GStreamer seek failure by making the cache proxy ALWAYS return HTTP 206 Partial Content, even for full file requests. This is the standard approach for video streaming servers.

## Fix #2: Don't Wait for Large Ranges

The initial fix caused playback to hang because it tried to wait for the ENTIRE 3.2GB file to be available before streaming.

**Problem**: 
- Proxy checked `has_byte_range(0, 3248213375)` for full file request
- Returned false (only 35/310 chunks cached)
- Tried to wait for ALL chunks → timeout → no playback

**Solution**:
- Only check/wait for small ranges (< 50MB)
- For large ranges (>= 50MB, including full file): Immediately use progressive streaming
- Progressive stream requests and waits for chunks individually as needed

**Code Changes** (src/cache/proxy.rs:329-334):
```rust
if length <= MAX_DIRECT_READ {  // Only wait for small ranges
    // Check if available, request if needed, wait
    // Then read directly into memory
} else {  // Large ranges (including full file)
    // Immediately start progressive streaming
    // Chunks requested/waited individually during stream
}
```

Now playback starts immediately and streams progressively, downloading chunks as needed.


## Root Cause

GStreamer's curlhttpsrc cannot seek within an existing HTTP 200 OK streaming connection. When the player seeks (e.g., to read MKV Cues at EOF), it needs to make a NEW HTTP request with a Range header. But curlhttpsrc only makes range requests if the server returns 206 from the first request.

The previous implementation:
- Returned `200 OK` for requests without Range header
- Returned `206 Partial Content` only for explicit range requests
- curlhttpsrc opened a 200 OK connection and couldn't seek within it
- Seeks failed with "got eos and didn't receive a complete header object"

## Changes Made

Modified `src/cache/proxy.rs`:

1. **Always treat requests as range requests** (line 301-313):
   - Requests without Range header default to `bytes=0-{total_size-1}` (full file)
   - This ensures ALL responses are 206 Partial Content with Content-Range headers

2. **Hybrid streaming approach** (line 368-417):
   - Small ranges (<50MB): Read into memory and return immediately (fast response)
   - Large ranges (>= 50MB, including full file): Use progressive streaming (avoid OOM)
   - Both return 206 with proper Content-Range headers

3. **Created `create_range_based_progressive_stream`** (line 516-607):
   - Similar to existing progressive stream but with start/end parameters
   - Allows streaming arbitrary byte ranges (not just from offset 0)
   - Requests chunks as needed with CRITICAL priority

## How It Works

**First Request** (no Range header):

→ Proxy treats as `Range: bytes=0-{size-1}`
→ Returns `206 Partial Content` with `Content-Range: bytes 0-3248213375/3248213376`
→ curlhttpsrc sees 206 and knows server supports seeking

**Seek Request** (user seeks to 70%):

→ Proxy returns `206 Partial Content` with `Content-Range: bytes 2273749363-3248213375/3248213376`
→ Progressive stream downloads chunk 217 (where byte 2273749363 lives) with CRITICAL priority
→ Streaming continues from that offset

**MKV Cues Access** (for accurate seeking):


## Benefits

1. **Standard HTTP video streaming**: Matches behavior of YouTube, Netflix, etc.
2. **GStreamer compatibility**: Works with curlhttpsrc's range request expectations
3. **Efficient memory usage**: Large files use streaming, small ranges use direct reads
4. **Chunk-based on demand**: Only downloads chunks that are actually requested
5. **Works with partial cache**: Seeking to 70% works even with only 10% cached

## Testing Required

- [ ] Seek to 70% in a video with only 10-20% cached
- [ ] Verify MKV playback with seeks (MKV requires Cues access)  
- [ ] Confirm all responses are 206 (check debug logs)
- [ ] Test that full file requests still stream progressively (not loaded into RAM)


## Changes Made

Modified `src/player/gstreamer_player.rs`:
- Added `iradio-mode=false` property configuration in the source-setup signal callback (line 687-690)
- This tells curlhttpsrc to treat the stream as seekable and make proper HTTP Range requests when seeking
- Critical for MKV files where GStreamer needs to read the Cues section (typically at end of file) to perform accurate seeks

## How It Works

When `iradio-mode=false`:
1. curlhttpsrc treats the HTTP source as a seekable file (not a live stream)
2. When GStreamer seeks (e.g., to read MKV Cues at EOF), curlhttpsrc makes a new HTTP Range request
3. Cache proxy receives the range request and serves the specific bytes from the appropriate chunk
4. Seek completes successfully even with partial cache

Without this fix:
- curlhttpsrc opens a single 200 OK connection
- When GStreamer seeks, it tries to read within that connection
- Cache only has sequential chunks, seek to EOF fails
- Error: "got eos and didn't receive a complete header object"

## Testing Required

Need to test:
- Seeking to positions >50% in a video with only 10-20% cached
- Verify MKV playback with seeks (MKV requires Cues access)
- Confirm range requests appear in debug logs when seeking
