## Description

The Plex authentication tab has unnecessary visual clutter with a large icon and explanatory paragraph. Streamline the interface by removing the 'Connect to Plex' section, renaming the sign-in button to 'Automatic Login', and hiding advanced options by default to create a cleaner, more focused authentication experience.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Remove the large Plex icon from the authentication tab
- [ ] #2 Remove the explanatory paragraph starting with 'Authenticate with your Plex account...'
- [ ] #3 Rename 'Sign in with Plex' button to 'Automatic Login'
- [ ] #4 Hide Advanced Options section by default (make it collapsed/expandable)
- [ ] #5 Ensure Advanced Options can be expanded when needed by users
- [ ] #6 Maintain all existing authentication functionality
<!-- AC:END -->
