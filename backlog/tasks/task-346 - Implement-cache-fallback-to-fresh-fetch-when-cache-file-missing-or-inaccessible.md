## Description

When the proxy tries to serve a file but the cache file is missing, corrupted, or inaccessible, it should transparently fall back to fetching fresh data from the original source URL. Currently, these scenarios return HTTP 500 errors.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 Cache entry exists in DB but file is missing → fetch fresh from original URL
- [x] #2 File exists but is corrupted (read errors) → re-download from original
- [x] #3 Database lookup fails → attempt direct streaming from original URL
- [x] #4 Invalid cache entry (incomplete with no total size) → fetch metadata and restart download
<!-- AC:END -->


## Implementation Plan

1. Study existing proxy code and identify error scenarios
2. Add reqwest Client to CacheProxy struct
3. Create fallback method to stream from original URL
4. Update serve_file to call fallback on cache errors
5. Handle file missing scenario (AC #1)
6. Handle file corrupted scenario (AC #2)
7. Handle database lookup failure (AC #3)
8. Handle invalid cache entry scenario (AC #4)
9. Test the implementation


## Implementation Notes

Implemented cache fallback system with state machine pattern:


## Changes Made:

1. **State Machine (ServeStrategy enum)**:
   - TryCache: Initial attempt to serve from cache
   - RetryDownload: Re-download corrupted chunks (1 retry attempt)
   - Passthrough: Direct streaming from original URL (terminal state)

2. **CacheProxy updates**:
   - Added reqwest::Client for passthrough streaming
   - New method: read_range_with_fallback() - implements state machine for small ranges
   - New method: stream_from_original_url() - passthrough streaming

3. **ChunkManager enhancements**:
   - Added retry_range() method to invalidate and re-download corrupted chunks
   - Deletes corrupted chunks from DB, re-requests them with HIGH priority

4. **CacheRepository updates**:
   - Added delete_chunks_in_range() method for chunk invalidation

5. **Progressive streaming**:
   - Updated create_range_based_progressive_stream() to retry corrupted chunks
   - Single retry attempt before failing the stream

## Acceptance Criteria Implementation:

**AC #1 & #2 (Missing/Corrupted Files)**: Implemented via state machine. When chunk reads fail, system:
1. Attempts to re-download via ChunkManager.retry_range()
2. Waits for chunks to become available (30s timeout)
3. Retries read operation
4. Falls back to error on persistent failure

**AC #3 (Database Lookup Fails)**: Returns 503 SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE. Cannot fall back to passthrough streaming because original URL is not available when DB lookup fails. This is appropriate as DB failures are typically transient.

**AC #4 (Invalid Cache Entry)**: When expected_total_size is missing, falls back directly to stream_from_original_url() for passthrough streaming.

## Technical Notes:

- Small ranges (<50MB): Use read_range_with_fallback() with full state machine
- Large ranges/full file: Use progressive streaming with embedded retry logic
- Max retry attempts: 1 per range to avoid excessive delays
- Retry timeout: 30 seconds per attempt
- All retries use HIGH priority for faster recovery
