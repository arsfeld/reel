## Description

The home button in the sidebar should not be displayed when there are no media sources configured, as it would lead to an empty page with no content to show.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Home button is hidden when no sources are configured
- [ ] #2 Home button appears when at least one source exists
- [ ] #3 Sidebar updates reactively when sources are added/removed
<!-- AC:END -->
