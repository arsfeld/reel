## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Icons are completely broken in the UI despite GTK debug showing icon cache is found. The WhiteSur-dark icon theme is being detected and loaded by GTK (confirmed via GTK_DEBUG=icontheme), but no icons are actually displaying in the application UI.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 All UI icons display correctly (sidebar navigation, media cards, player controls)
- [ ] #2 Verify icon theme loads via GTK_DEBUG=icontheme showing 'found icon cache for WhiteSur-dark'
- [ ] #3 No broken/missing icon placeholders in the UI
- [ ] #4 Icons work consistently across application restart
<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Plan

<!-- SECTION:PLAN:BEGIN -->
1. Run the app with GTK_DEBUG=icontheme to see icon search paths and what's being loaded
2. Check if icons are actually present in the theme directories
3. Test with simple icon names to see if the basic GTK icon loading works
4. Investigate if libadwaita is interfering with icon theme
5. Check if size directories are properly set up in the icon theme
6. Look into GTK4 icon loading on macOS - might need explicit icon search path setup
<!-- SECTION:PLAN:END -->

## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
Already attempted fixes in flake.nix:
- Added dontDropIconThemeCache = true to preserve icon cache files
- Added Adwaita to Inherits line in index.theme
- Fixed sed command to properly update theme name
- Added apps directory to WhiteSur-dark variant
- Fixed gtk-update-icon-cache to use correct path (gtk3.dev)

Already attempted fixes in src/main.rs:
- Added programmatic icon theme setting via GtkSettings on macOS (line 40-46)

GTK debug confirms:
- Icon cache IS being found for WhiteSur-dark
- Theme inheritance chain works (WhiteSur-dark -> Adwaita -> hicolor)

Next steps to investigate:
- Check if icons are using correct icon names
- Verify icon sizes are available in the theme
- Test with simpler icon names (e.g., "folder" vs specific symbolic names)
- Check if libadwaita is overriding icon theme settings

Root cause: GTK4 on macOS cannot render SVG icons because gdk-pixbuf doesn't include the SVG loader by default.

Solution implemented:
1. Created combined GDK Pixbuf loader package in flake.nix that merges standard loaders with SVG loader from librsvg
2. Set GDK_PIXBUF_MODULEDIR and GDK_PIXBUF_MODULE_FILE environment variables to point to combined loaders
3. Added explicit icon search paths to IconTheme on macOS by parsing XDG_DATA_DIRS

Files modified:
- src/main.rs: Added macOS-specific icon theme configuration with explicit search path setup
- flake.nix: Created gdkPixbufWithSvg derivation to combine pixbuf loaders
- nix/devshell.nix: Set GDK_PIXBUF environment variables on macOS

Requires exiting and re-entering nix develop shell to apply changes.

**UPDATE**: Initial fix did not resolve the issue, but the approach is correct.

The SVG loader is still not being properly loaded. Need to:
1. Verify the combined loaders.cache was generated correctly
2. Check if GDK_PIXBUF_MODULE_FILE is being read by GTK at runtime
3. Test if the SVG loader dylib is accessible and not being blocked by macOS security
4. May need to use a wrapper script or different approach to force GDK to load the SVG module

**CRITICAL FINDING**: The SVG loader dylib exists but is NOT in loaders.cache!

gdk-pixbuf-query-loaders was not picking up the .dylib file when using wildcard *.{so,dylib}

Fixed by specifying paths separately:
  $out/lib/.../loaders/*.so \
  $out/lib/.../loaders/*.dylib

Need to rebuild dev shell and test.

**ROOT CAUSE FOUND**: SVG loader dylib has broken rpath!

Error: Library not loaded: @rpath/librsvg-2.2.dylib

The SVG pixbuf loader can't find librsvg dylib at runtime.\n\nSolution: Set DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH to include librsvg/lib path.\n\nAdded to nix/devshell.nix:\n  export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH="${pkgs.librsvg}/lib:..."

**FINAL SOLUTION**:

1. The SVG loader dylib has @rpath dependency on librsvg-2.2.dylib
2. Set DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH during loaders.cache generation (in flake.nix)
3. Set DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH at runtime (in nix/devshell.nix)

Both changes needed:
- flake.nix: Set DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH when running gdk-pixbuf-query-loaders
- nix/devshell.nix: Export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH for runtime

Files modified:
- flake.nix (gdkPixbufWithSvg buildCommand)
- nix/devshell.nix (added DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH export)
- src/main.rs (icon search paths already added)

Next: Exit shell, re-enter with `nix develop`, test with `cargo run`

**COMPLETED**: Committed in 78b8919

To test the fix:
1. Exit current nix shell
2. Re-enter: nix develop
3. Run: cargo run
4. Verify icons display correctly in UI
