## Description

Review navigation proposals and journal documentation to determine if they are still relevant or should be archived/updated

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Assess if navigation-proposals.md reflects current navigation implementation
- [ ] #2 Determine if journal.md contains outdated development history
- [ ] #3 Identify any valuable historical context to preserve
- [ ] #4 Recommend archival or update approach for each document
<!-- AC:END -->


## Implementation Plan

1. Review navigation-proposals.md for current relevance
2. Review journal.md for historical value
3. Assess whether content should be updated, archived, or removed
4. Provide recommendations


## Implementation Notes

## Document Assessment Summary

### navigation-proposals.md
**Status**: HIGHLY RELEVANT - Keep and reference
**Purpose**: Design document for upcoming navigation improvements
**Content**: Detailed proposals for filters, collections, unwatched indicators, and UI enhancements
**Recommendation**: This is an active planning document with concrete implementation details that should be turned into tasks

### journal.md  
**Status**: HISTORICALLY VALUABLE - Keep but mark as completed
**Purpose**: Migration history from GTK to Relm4 architecture
**Content**: Chronicles the successful migration completed in January 2025
**Recommendation**: Valuable historical record, referenced in README, should be preserved


## Findings

### navigation-proposals.md Relevance:
- Contains **actionable implementation plans** for navigation improvements
- Includes specific technical details (CSS, database schema)
- Proposes 4 major improvements: Filter tabs, Smart Collections, Unwatched indicators, Enhanced home page
- Has phased implementation plan ready for execution
- Should be converted into backlog tasks for implementation

### journal.md Relevance:
- Documents the **completed Relm4 migration** (85% done as of January 2025)
- Contains valuable lessons learned and architecture decisions
- Referenced in README.md as migration progress tracker
- Historical record of project evolution
- Lists 23 outstanding TODOs that may need task creation

## Recommendations

1. **navigation-proposals.md**: Keep as active design document. Create tasks for:
   - Implement unwatched indicators with glow effect
   - Add predefined filter tabs (All, Unwatched, Recently Added)
   - Fix home page section replacement bug
   - Add genre/year quick filters
   - Implement smart collections

2. **journal.md**: Keep as historical documentation. Consider:
   - Adding completion note at top indicating migration is complete
   - Extracting the 23 TODOs into separate tasks if not already addressed
   - Moving to an "archive" or "history" folder if desired

Both documents serve important but different purposes - one for future work, one for project history.
