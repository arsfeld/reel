## Description

The GStreamer player on macOS reports successful playback start but never actually plays media. The player gets stuck in Ready state even after attempting to transition to Playing state. The logs show 'Async state change still pending after 3s, current: Ready' warnings, and the pipeline never properly initializes the decoding elements. This affects users trying to use GStreamer as an alternative to MPV on macOS.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 Investigate why GStreamer pipeline stays in Ready state on macOS
- [x] #2 Debug the uridecodebin3 element initialization and connection
- [x] #3 Fix the async state transition issue preventing playback
- [ ] #4 Verify GStreamer plays media successfully on macOS
- [x] #5 Add proper error handling for pipeline state failures
<!-- AC:END -->


## Implementation Plan

1. Examine the GStreamer player implementation to understand current state management
2. Research macOS-specific GStreamer issues and check if all required plugins are available
3. Add detailed logging to trace pipeline state transitions
4. Fix the async state change handling and ensure proper element connections
5. Test with various media formats to verify playback works correctly
6. Add error recovery mechanisms for pipeline state failures


## Implementation Notes

Fixed the GStreamer playback issue on macOS by implementing proper state transition handling:

1. **Removed premature Ready state transition** - The load_media() function no longer sets the playbin to Ready state immediately. This allows the play() method to handle the complete state transition sequence.

2. **Added macOS-specific state transition logic** - On macOS, the play() method now performs a proper state transition sequence:
   - Null -> Ready (with timeout and verification)
   - Ready -> Paused (for preroll, with 5-second timeout)
   - Paused -> Playing (final transition)

3. **Enhanced video sink setup for macOS** - Added videoscale element to the macOS video sink pipeline for better compatibility and let playbin auto-select sink when no custom sink is configured.

4. **Added connection-speed property** - Set connection-speed on uridecodebin for better buffering behavior.

5. **Improved error handling** - Added bus error checking during preroll phase to detect and report pipeline failures early.

These changes address the core issue where the pipeline was getting stuck in Ready state due to incomplete element initialization and improper state transition sequencing on macOS.

**Error Recovery Mechanism Added:**
- When state transition fails, the player now attempts recovery by resetting to Null state
- After reset, it retries playback with a direct Playing state transition
- Enhanced error reporting to collect and display all bus errors and warnings
- Properly updates player state to Error when recovery fails
- Provides detailed error messages including source element information
