## Description

Create a SeaORM migration to add the home_sections and home_section_items tables to the database. This migration should create the proper schema with indexes for efficient querying.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 Create migration file m20250107_000001_add_home_sections.rs
- [x] #2 Define home_sections table with proper columns and primary key
- [x] #3 Define home_section_items junction table with composite primary key
- [x] #4 Add indexes for source_id and hub_identifier lookups
- [x] #5 Add foreign key constraints to ensure referential integrity
- [x] #6 Test migration up and down operations
<!-- AC:END -->


## Implementation Plan

1. Review existing migrations to understand patterns
2. Create new migration file with proper structure
3. Define home_sections table schema
4. Define home_section_items junction table
5. Add necessary indexes
6. Add foreign key constraints
7. Test migration operations


## Implementation Notes

Implemented complete database migration for home sections functionality. The migration creates two tables: home_sections for storing section metadata and home_section_items as a junction table linking sections to media items. Added proper indexes for efficient querying, foreign key constraints for referential integrity, and both up/down migration operations. The migration follows existing project patterns and integrates with the SeaORM migration system.
