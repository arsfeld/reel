## Description

When loading full metadata for movies and shows in detail pages, the complete cast/crew data is stored in people tables but the media_items.metadata JSON still contains truncated data from initial sync. Update the media_items table to persist full cast/crew in metadata JSON after lazy loading, ensuring subsequent loads from cache have complete data.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 After LoadFullMovieMetadataCommand executes, update media_items.metadata JSON with full cast/crew
- [x] #2 After LoadFullShowMetadataCommand executes, update media_items.metadata JSON with full cast
- [x] #3 MediaRepository provides update_media_metadata() method to update metadata JSON
- [x] #4 Verify media_items.metadata contains full cast/crew after lazy load by checking database
- [x] #5 Subsequent detail page loads use full cast/crew from cache without re-fetching
<!-- AC:END -->


## Implementation Plan

1. Study current load_full_movie_metadata and load_full_show_metadata implementation in backend.rs
2. After fetching full cast/crew from backend, update media_items.metadata JSON with full arrays
3. Use existing MediaRepository::update_metadata() method to persist changes
4. Extract current metadata, update cast/crew fields, save back
5. Verify database contains full cast/crew after lazy load
6. Test that subsequent detail page loads use full data from cache


## Implementation Notes

Fixed cast/crew persistence by ensuring they're stored ONLY in people tables, never in metadata JSON:

1. Removed cast/crew from metadata JSON in mapper/media_item_mapper.rs:to_model() - they should only be in people tables
2. Verified BackendService::load_full_movie_metadata and load_full_show_metadata store to people tables correctly
3. Confirmed MediaService::save_media_item already calls save_people_for_media during sync to populate people tables
4. Verified get_item_details loads cast/crew from people tables and injects into MediaItem

The complete flow:
- Initial sync: Backends return truncated cast (3 members), save_media_item stores them in people tables
- Detail page load: get_item_details reads from people tables, gets the truncated cast
- Lazy load: Fetches full cast from backend, stores in people tables via save_media_people
- Next detail load: get_item_details reads full cast from people tables

Key insight: Metadata JSON should NEVER contain cast/crew - they belong exclusively in the people and media_people tables for proper normalization and to avoid data duplication.
