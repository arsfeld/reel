## Description

The player window needs to be draggable so users can reposition it on their screen. Currently it may lack proper draggable areas or header bar implementation, making it difficult or impossible to move the window around.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Player window has proper draggable header/title bar area
- [ ] #2 Window can be moved by clicking and dragging the title bar
- [ ] #3 Dragging works in both windowed and non-fullscreen modes
- [ ] #4 Window controls (close, minimize, maximize) remain accessible
- [ ] #5 Dragging behavior is consistent with other GNOME applications
<!-- AC:END -->
