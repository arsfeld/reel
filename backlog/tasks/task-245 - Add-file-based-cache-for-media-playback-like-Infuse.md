## Description

Implement a file-based caching system for media playback that downloads and stores media files locally, similar to Infuse's caching mechanism. This will enable smoother playback, reduce bandwidth usage on repeated views, and provide offline playback capabilities.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Design cache storage architecture with configurable size limits
- [ ] #2 Implement progressive download during playback
- [ ] #3 Create cache management system with LRU eviction policy
- [ ] #4 Support partial file caching for seek operations
- [ ] #5 Implement cache persistence across app restarts
- [ ] #6 Create cache status indicators in UI
