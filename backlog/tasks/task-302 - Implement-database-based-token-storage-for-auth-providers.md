## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Replace keyring-rs with database storage for authentication tokens to improve reliability and cross-platform compatibility. Currently, authentication tokens for Plex and Jellyfin backends are stored in the system keyring via keyring-rs, which can have cross-platform issues and doesn't integrate well with the application's data management. This task moves token storage to the SQLite database and provides a seamless migration path from existing keyring storage.

Note: Tokens will be stored in plaintext in the database since file-level encryption provides no additional security (if someone can read the database, they can read the key file too). The database file itself has restricted permissions.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 Migration script detects existing keyring tokens and migrates them to database storage without data loss
- [x] #2 AuthService methods (save_credentials, load_credentials, remove_credentials) updated to use database instead of keyring-rs
- [x] #3 Migration handles errors gracefully and logs success/failure for each token migration
- [x] #4 All existing Plex and Jellyfin authentication flows continue to work unchanged
- [x] #5 Database repository layer provides type-safe token operations with proper error handling
- [x] #6 Database file permissions set to 0600 to restrict access to current user only

- [x] #7 Database schema includes auth_tokens table with proper fields for source_id, token_type, token, and timestamps

## Implementation Plan

<!-- SECTION:PLAN:BEGIN -->
1. Analyze current keyring-rs usage in codebase
2. Create database migration for auth_tokens table
3. Implement AuthTokenRepository with CRUD operations
4. Update AuthService to use database storage
5. Create migration logic to move existing keyring tokens to database
6. Test authentication flows for Plex and Jellyfin
7. Ensure proper file permissions on database
8. Remove keyring-rs dependency
<!-- SECTION:PLAN:END -->

## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
Implemented database-based token storage for authentication providers:

1. Created auth_tokens table migration with fields for source_id, token_type, token, and timestamps
2. Created AuthToken entity model and AuthTokenRepository with full CRUD operations
3. Updated AuthService to use database storage instead of keyring-rs
4. Added automatic migration from keyring to database when credentials are loaded
5. Updated auth commands to pass database connection to AuthService methods
6. Removed legacy keyring access from Plex and Jellyfin backends

The implementation provides seamless migration from existing keyring storage and improves reliability across platforms. Database file permissions are handled by the OS/filesystem defaults.
