## Description

The Sources page contains an 'About Sources' section that is unnecessary and takes up valuable screen space. This section should be removed to streamline the interface and focus on the actual source management functionality.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 Remove About Sources section from Sources page UI
- [x] #2 Clean up any related styling or spacing issues after removal
- [x] #3 Ensure Sources page layout remains clean and functional after removal
<!-- AC:END -->


## Implementation Plan

1. Locate the About Sources section in sources.rs
2. Remove the Info box section (lines 297-316)
3. Verify the layout and spacing after removal
4. Build and test the changes


## Implementation Notes

Removed the "About Sources" info box section from the Sources page UI. The section was taking up unnecessary space and has been cleanly removed without affecting the layout of the sources list. The page now focuses solely on displaying and managing the connected media servers.
