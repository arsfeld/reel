## Description

The Relm4 player doesn't properly handle or display errors. When media fails to load or playback errors occur, users should see clear error messages and have options to retry or go back.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Display clear error messages when media fails to load
- [ ] #2 Show retry button on playback errors
- [ ] #3 Implement automatic retry with exponential backoff
- [ ] #4 Log detailed error information for debugging
- [ ] #5 Handle network connectivity issues gracefully
- [ ] #6 Provide fallback to different quality streams if available
<!-- AC:END -->
