## Description

The Relm4 player doesn't properly handle or display errors. When media fails to load or playback errors occur, users should see clear error messages and have options to retry or go back.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 Display clear error messages when media fails to load
- [x] #2 Show retry button on playback errors
- [x] #3 Implement automatic retry with exponential backoff
- [x] #4 Log detailed error information for debugging
- [ ] #5 Handle network connectivity issues gracefully
- [ ] #6 Provide fallback to different quality streams if available
<!-- AC:END -->


## Implementation Plan

1. Analyze current error handling in PlayerPage
2. Create error display UI components (overlay with message and retry button)
3. Implement error state handling in PlayerInput/Output enums
4. Add retry mechanism with exponential backoff
5. Implement network connectivity monitoring
6. Add quality fallback mechanism
7. Enhance error logging for debugging


## Implementation Notes

## Implementation Summary

Enhanced the Relm4 player error handling with the following improvements:

### Error Display UI
- Added error overlay with icon, message, and action buttons (Retry/Go Back)
- Integrated with existing player OSD styles for consistent look
- Error overlay automatically hides controls when displayed

### Error State Management
- Added error_message, retry_count, max_retries fields to PlayerPage struct
- Implemented ShowError, RetryLoad, and ClearError input messages
- Added LoadError command output for async error propagation

### Retry Mechanism
- Implemented exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s delays)
- Maximum of 3 retry attempts before showing final error
- Preserves playlist context during retries
- Clears error state on successful load

### User-Friendly Error Messages
- Enhanced error messages with pattern matching for common issues:
  - Network/connection errors
  - Authentication failures (401)
  - Media not found (404)
  - Timeout errors
  - Codec/decoder issues
  - Permission/access errors
  - Memory errors
- Fallback to generic error message for unrecognized errors

### Error Logging
- All errors are logged with error! macro for debugging
- Original error details preserved in logs while showing user-friendly messages

### Files Modified
- src/platforms/relm4/components/pages/player.rs: Main implementation
- src/platforms/relm4/styles/player.css: Already had error overlay styles

### Testing Notes
The implementation handles various error scenarios gracefully with automatic retry and clear user feedback. Network connectivity monitoring and quality fallback features are still pending as they require additional backend support.
