## Description

Proxy stats are being logged every period even when the proxy has never been used (all zeros). This creates noise in the logs without providing useful information. Stats should only be printed when there is actual proxy activity to report.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 Add conditional check before logging proxy stats
- [x] #2 Only log stats if request count > 0 or proxy has been used at least once
- [ ] #3 Verify logs are clean when proxy is unused
- [ ] #4 Verify stats still appear when proxy is actively used
<!-- AC:END -->


## Implementation Plan

1. Locate proxy stats logging in src/cache/proxy.rs
2. Add conditional check to only log when requests_served > 0
3. Build and verify compilation
4. Test with and without proxy usage to verify behavior


## Implementation Notes

Added conditional check to only log proxy stats when the proxy has been actively used.

Changes:
- Added `use std::sync::atomic::Ordering;` import to src/cache/proxy.rs
- Modified stats reporting loop in `start_stats_reporter()` method (lines 156-160)
- Added conditional: `if stats.requests_served.load(Ordering::Relaxed) > 0`
- Stats are now only logged when at least one request has been served

This prevents noisy all-zero stat logs when the proxy is not in use, while preserving normal stats logging when the proxy is actively serving requests.

Code compiles successfully. ACs #3 and #4 can be verified by running the application and observing that:
- Logs remain clean when no media is played (no proxy stats appear)
- Stats appear normally when media playback uses the proxy
