## Description

Split the large library.rs file (2930 lines) into logical modules for better maintainability. This is NOT a refactor - just moving code to different files while keeping the same logic.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 All code moved to appropriate module files
- [x] #2 Original library.rs updated with mod declarations and re-exports
- [x] #3 All imports updated correctly
- [x] #4 Code compiles without errors
- [x] #5 No functionality changes - purely organizational
<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Notes

Successfully broke down library.rs (2936 lines) into modular structure:

**Module Structure:**
- library/mod.rs - Main module with LibraryPage struct and AsyncComponent
- library/types.rs - Type definitions (SortBy, SortOrder, WatchStatus, ViewMode, FilterState, etc.)
- library/messages.rs - Message enums (LibraryPageInput, LibraryPageOutput)
- library/filters.rs - Filter helper methods
- library/ui_builders.rs - UI popover builders
- library/data.rs - Data loading and viewport management

**Implementation Details:**
- All 7 subtasks completed successfully
- Added #[relm4::component(pub async)] attribute to AsyncComponent impl
- Added explicit view! macro import for proper resolution
- All methods use pub(super) visibility for encapsulation
- Code compiles without errors (cargo check/build/run all successful)
- Application launches and works correctly
- No functionality changes - purely organizational refactoring

**Results:**
- Better code organization and maintainability
- Each module has a clear, focused purpose
- Easier to navigate and understand codebase
- Sets pattern for future component modularization
