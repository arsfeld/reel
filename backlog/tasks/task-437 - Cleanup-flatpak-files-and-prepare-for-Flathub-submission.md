## Implementation Summary

Successfully prepared Reel for Flathub submission by cleaning up flatpak configuration and ensuring compliance with Flathub requirements.

### Changes Made

1. **Manifest Cleanup (`dev.arsfeld.Reel.json`)**:
   - Removed unused blueprint-compiler module (no .blp files in project)
   - Removed `--filesystem=xdg-pictures:ro` permission (not needed)
   - Added LICENSE file installation to `/app/share/licenses/dev.arsfeld.Reel/`
   - Updated git tag from v0.1.0 to v0.7.5 (current version)
   - Verified all finish-args are minimal and necessary

2. **Metadata Updates (`data/dev.arsfeld.Reel.metainfo.xml`)**:
   - Added release entry for v0.7.5 (2025-10-06)
   - Validated successfully with appstreamcli
   - Maintains high-quality AppStream metadata standards

3. **New Files Created**:
   - `flathub.json`: Specifies x86_64 and aarch64 architecture support
   - `docs/FLATHUB_SUBMISSION.md`: Comprehensive guide for Flathub submission process

4. **Documentation Updates**:
   - Updated README.md Flatpak section with build instructions
   - Added reference to Flathub submission guide
   - Removed "Coming Soon" status, replaced with actual instructions

5. **Dependencies**:
   - Generated fresh `cargo-sources.json` (374KB) from Cargo.lock
   - Verified JSON manifest syntax is valid

### Validation Results

- ✅ AppStream metadata validates successfully (appstreamcli)
- ✅ Manifest JSON is valid (python json.tool)
- ✅ All required files properly installed
- ✅ Minimal permissions (following Flathub guidelines)
- ✅ LICENSE file in correct location
- ✅ Architecture support properly specified

### Ready for Flathub

The application is now ready for Flathub submission. All requirements are met:
- Manifest follows best practices
- Metadata meets quality standards
- Permissions are minimal and justified
- Documentation is comprehensive
- Build process is clean and reproducible

Next steps for Flathub submission are documented in `docs/FLATHUB_SUBMISSION.md`.
