## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
The GStreamer player controls UI doesn't properly reflect the actual playback state. When playback fails or state changes occur, the play/pause button and other controls may show incorrect states. This creates a confusing user experience where the controls don't match what's actually happening with playback.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 Investigate how player state is communicated between GStreamerPlayer and UI controls
- [x] #2 Ensure player state updates are properly propagated to the UI on all state changes
- [x] #3 Handle error states properly - controls should reflect when playback has failed
- [x] #4 Add proper state synchronization when transitioning between Ready/Paused/Playing states
- [x] #5 Test controls accurately reflect state during buffering, seeking, and error conditions

## Implementation Plan

<!-- SECTION:PLAN:BEGIN -->
1. Analyze state flow from GStreamerPlayer to UI controls
2. Identify discrepancies between internal state and UI state reporting
3. Fix state updates in handle_bus_message to properly update internal state
4. Ensure get_state method returns accurate state from both internal state and pipeline state
5. Add proper error state handling and propagation
6. Test state synchronization during various playback scenarios
<!-- SECTION:PLAN:END -->

## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
Fixed GStreamer player controls state synchronization issues:

1. **Updated bus message handler** to properly update internal state when receiving StateChanged messages from the playbin element
2. **Fixed play() method** to update internal state immediately after successful state changes (Success, Async, NoPreroll cases)
3. **Added proper error state handling** to ensure UI reflects when playback fails
4. **Removed duplicate state updates** that were causing inconsistencies

The key issue was that the handle_bus_message method was only logging state changes but not updating the internal PlayerState, causing a mismatch between actual pipeline state and what the UI displayed.
