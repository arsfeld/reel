## Description

The GStreamer player controls UI doesn't properly reflect the actual playback state. When playback fails or state changes occur, the play/pause button and other controls may show incorrect states. This creates a confusing user experience where the controls don't match what's actually happening with playback.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Investigate how player state is communicated between GStreamerPlayer and UI controls
- [ ] #2 Ensure player state updates are properly propagated to the UI on all state changes
- [ ] #3 Handle error states properly - controls should reflect when playback has failed
- [ ] #4 Add proper state synchronization when transitioning between Ready/Paused/Playing states
- [ ] #5 Test controls accurately reflect state during buffering, seeking, and error conditions
<!-- AC:END -->
