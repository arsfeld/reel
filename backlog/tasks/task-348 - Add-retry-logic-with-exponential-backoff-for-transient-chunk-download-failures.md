## Description

Implement retry logic for chunk downloads that fail due to transient network issues, timeouts, or temporary server errors. Should distinguish between retryable errors (network timeouts, 503) and permanent errors (404, 403).

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Identify retryable vs permanent HTTP errors
- [ ] #2 Implement exponential backoff for retries (e.g., 1s, 2s, 4s, 8s)
- [ ] #3 Max retry count configurable (default: 3 retries)
- [ ] #4 Log retry attempts with context
- [ ] #5 Permanent errors (404, 403) should fail fast without retries
<!-- AC:END -->
