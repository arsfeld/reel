## Description

Review the configuration documentation to ensure it accurately describes the current configuration system and all available settings

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 Verify all configuration options are documented
- [x] #2 Check default values match implementation
- [x] #3 Validate file paths and structure
- [x] #4 Ensure environment variable documentation is accurate
- [x] #5 Update any deprecated configuration options
<!-- AC:END -->


## Implementation Notes

Completely rewrote config.md documentation to accurately reflect the current simplified configuration system in config.rs. The new documentation covers:
- Simplified two-level structure (Config with only PlaybackConfig)
- Correct default values matching the implementation
- Accurate file paths for macOS and Linux
- Current usage patterns in player components
- Removed outdated references to complex hierarchies that no longer exist
- Documented known limitations and removed features
