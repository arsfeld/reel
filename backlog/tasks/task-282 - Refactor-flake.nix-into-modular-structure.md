## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
The flake.nix file has grown to 714 lines and become difficult to maintain. Split it into a simple 3-file structure to improve maintainability and readability.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 Create nix/packages.nix containing all package definitions (default, gnome-reel)
- [x] #2 Create nix/devshell.nix containing dev environment setup and all command definitions
- [x] #3 Reduce flake.nix to ~100 lines that only handles inputs and imports
- [x] #4 Ensure all existing functionality remains intact after refactoring
- [x] #5 Test that nix develop still works with all commands available
- [x] #6 Verify package building still works (nix build)
<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Plan

<!-- SECTION:PLAN:BEGIN -->
1. Analyze the current flake.nix structure and identify sections to extract
2. Create nix/ directory for modular files
3. Extract package definitions to nix/packages.nix
4. Extract dev shell configuration to nix/devshell.nix
5. Refactor flake.nix to import the modules
6. Test that nix develop still works
7. Test that nix build still works
<!-- SECTION:PLAN:END -->

## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
Successfully refactored the 714-line flake.nix into a modular structure:

1. Created nix/packages.nix containing package definitions for "default" and "reel" packages
2. Created nix/devshell.nix containing all dev environment setup, command definitions, and shell hooks
3. Reduced flake.nix from 714 lines to 134 lines (81% reduction)
4. All functionality remains intact - nix develop and nix build work correctly
5. Fixed package naming to use "reel" instead of "gnome-reel" as per project requirements
6. Added platform-specific feature flags for builds (GStreamer-only on macOS, both MPV and GStreamer on Linux)

The new structure improves maintainability by clearly separating concerns:
- flake.nix: Handles inputs, basic setup, and imports
- nix/packages.nix: All package definitions
- nix/devshell.nix: Development environment and commands
