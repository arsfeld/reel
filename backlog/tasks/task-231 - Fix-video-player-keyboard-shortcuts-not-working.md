## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
The video player has a comprehensive keyboard event handler implemented (lines 1131-1268 in src/ui/pages/player.rs) with shortcuts for playback control, seeking, volume, fullscreen, and more. However, these keyboard shortcuts are currently not being triggered when keys are pressed during video playback. This significantly impacts user experience as keyboard navigation is essential for video players.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 Keyboard shortcuts respond when keys are pressed during video playback
- [x] #2 All implemented shortcuts work as expected (space for play/pause, arrow keys for seeking, f/F11 for fullscreen, etc.)
- [x] #3 Focus management ensures the player widget receives keyboard events
- [x] #4 Shortcuts work in both windowed and fullscreen modes
<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Plan

<!-- SECTION:PLAN:BEGIN -->
1. Analyze the current keyboard event handling setup
2. Identify that the root Overlay widget needs to be focusable and have focus
3. Add set_focusable(true) and set_can_focus(true) to the root Overlay
4. Ensure the widget grabs focus when the player page is shown
5. Test keyboard shortcuts in both windowed and fullscreen modes
<!-- SECTION:PLAN:END -->

## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
Fixed keyboard shortcut functionality by:

1. Made the root gtk::Overlay widget focusable by adding set_focusable: true and set_can_focus: true to its properties
2. Added grab_focus() call in init() method after widget creation to ensure the player has focus when initialized
3. Added grab_focus() call when media state changes to Playing to ensure focus when playback starts
4. Added grab_focus() call after fullscreen toggle to maintain focus across display mode changes

The issue was that the gtk::Overlay widget that serves as the root container for the player was not focusable by default, preventing it from receiving keyboard events. By making it focusable and ensuring it grabs focus at key moments (initialization, playback start, fullscreen toggle), keyboard events now properly reach the event handler.
