## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
The main codebase compiles successfully but tests still have compilation errors, primarily in src/services/core/media.rs. Tests are using MediaItemModel fields that don't exist in the actual model. These fields should be stored in the metadata JSON field instead. Similar pattern was already fixed in media_repository.rs tests.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 All tests compile without errors
- [x] #2 All tests execute successfully
- [x] #3 LibraryType enum variants are correctly used (Movies, Shows, Music instead of Movie, Show, Music)
- [x] #4 MediaItemModel creation uses only existing fields
- [x] #5 Deprecated/non-existent fields are moved to metadata JSON field
- [x] #6 Test data creation follows the same pattern as fixed media_repository.rs tests
<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
Fixed all test compilation and execution errors. Made the following changes:

1. Fixed MediaService::search_media calls to include the new library_id and media_type parameters (now takes 4 args instead of 2)
2. Fixed MediaItem field access to use methods (title() instead of .title)
3. Fixed MediaService::get_media_items calls to use u32 for offset/limit parameters instead of Option types
4. Fixed genres field in media_repository tests to use sea_orm::JsonValue instead of Vec<String>
5. Fixed LibraryRepository::update to explicitly set all updatable fields
6. Removed unused imports from test modules

All 173 tests now pass successfully.
