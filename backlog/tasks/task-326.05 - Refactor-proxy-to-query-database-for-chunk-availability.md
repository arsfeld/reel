## Description

Refactor proxy to intelligently handle chunk requests:

**Current Issues**:
- Checks file size on disk (unreliable for sparse files)
- Complex state checking and waiting logic
- Doesn't know about chunk boundaries\n\n**New Approach**:\n1. **Range request arrives** → Query database for chunks in range\n2. **All chunks available** → Read from file and serve immediately\n3. **Chunks missing** → \n   - Request chunks from ChunkManager with HIGH priority\n   - WAIT for chunks to download (with timeout)\n   - Serve once available\n   - Timeout after reasonable period (e.g., 30s) → return 503\n4. **Non-ranged request** → Return 206 with first available chunk range, include Content-Range with total size\n\n**Smart Waiting**:\n- Subscribe to chunk completion events\n- Wake up when requested chunks complete\n- Progressive timeout (5s, 10s, 30s) with exponential backoff\n- Cancel chunk request if client disconnects\n\n**Key Benefits**:\n- Client doesn't need to retry - proxy handles it\n- Automatic prioritization of user-requested data\n- Smooth seeking experience

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] #5 Proxy handles non-ranged requests correctly
- [ ] #6 Remove all in-memory state checking from proxy
- [ ] #7 Add tests for various range request scenarios
- [x] #8 Proxy queries database for chunk availability on range requests
- [x] #9 Proxy serves data immediately when all chunks available
- [x] #10 Proxy requests missing chunks from ChunkManager with high priority
- [x] #11 Proxy waits for chunk download with smart timeout
- [ ] #12 Proxy handles client disconnection during wait

- [x] #16 Proxy handles full file requests with progressive streaming
- [x] #17 Progressive stream waits for and requests missing chunks sequentially
- [x] #18 Full file streaming works without client retries
<!-- AC:END -->


## Implementation Plan

1. Add ChunkManager dependency to CacheProxy
2. Replace file-size checks with ChunkManager queries
3. Implement chunk-based range request handling:
   - Query ChunkManager for chunk availability
   - Request missing chunks with HIGH priority
   - Wait for chunks with timeout
   - Read and serve chunks from ChunkStore
4. Implement progressive streaming for full file requests:
   - Stream chunks sequentially
   - Request and wait for missing chunks as needed
   - Use CRITICAL priority for current chunk
5. Remove state machine dependency
6. Update serve_file() to use chunk-based logic
7. Test range request scenarios
8. Test progressive streaming


## Implementation Notes

## Handling Non-Ranged Requests (Full File)

When client requests entire file without Range header:

**Option A: Progressive Streaming** (Recommended)
```rust
// Stream chunks sequentially, waiting for missing ones
let mut current_byte = 0;
while current_byte < total_size {
    // Find next chunk
    let chunk = db.get_chunk_at(current_byte)?;
    
    if chunk.exists() {
        // Stream this chunk
        stream_chunk(chunk).await?;
        current_byte = chunk.end_byte + 1;
    } else {
        // Request missing chunk and WAIT
        let chunk_end = current_byte + CHUNK_SIZE;
        chunk_manager.request_chunk(current_byte, chunk_end, HIGH_PRIORITY);
        
        // Wait for it (with timeout)
        wait_for_chunk(current_byte, chunk_end, timeout).await?;
        
        // Now stream it
        let chunk = db.get_chunk_at(current_byte)?;
        stream_chunk(chunk).await?;
        current_byte = chunk.end_byte + 1;
    }
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Single connection, no re-requests
- Automatic sequential downloading
- Smooth streaming experience

**Option B: Return First Chunk Only**
- Return 206 with first contiguous chunk
- Forces client to make range requests
- Simpler but more round-trips

**Recommendation**: Use Option A for non-ranged requests, Option B only as fallback if client doesn't support progressive streaming.

Updated chunk size from 2MB to 10MB throughout CACHE_DESIGN.md and implementation code to match task-326.03 decisions.

Added ChunkManager and ChunkStore to CacheProxy constructor and FileCache initialization.

Next: Refactor proxy serve_file() to use chunk-based queries instead of file-size checks.

Checkpoint 1 Complete:
- Added CacheRepository to CacheProxy for database lookups
- Updated all constructors to accept repository, chunk_manager, chunk_store
- FileCache now creates and passes all dependencies
- Code compiles successfully

Next: Begin refactoring serve_file() method to use chunk-based queries

Added new chunk-based progressive streaming function (create_chunk_based_progressive_stream):
- Uses ChunkManager to check availability
- Requests missing chunks with CRITICAL priority
- Waits for chunks using event-based notification
- Reads from ChunkStore
- No fallbacks to old methods

Next: Complete the serve_file() body replacement


## Major Refactoring Complete - serve_file() Now Fully Chunk-Based

### What Changed
**File Size Reduction**: 1068 lines → 738 lines (-330 lines, -31%)

**Removed Code** (NO FALLBACKS):
- All state_machine wait logic (lines of polling loops removed)
- All file-size based availability checks
- All disk-based guessing of download progress
- Entire old progressive_stream function
- Complex initialization wait loops

**New Implementation**:
1. **serve_file() method** (152 lines, was 566 lines):
   - Queries database for cache entry and entry_id
   - Uses ChunkManager.has_byte_range() for availability checks
   - Requests missing chunks with HIGH priority
   - Waits for chunks with 30s timeout using event-based notification
   - Reads from ChunkStore using chunk-based offsets
   - Returns 503 with Retry-After on timeout

2. **create_chunk_based_progressive_stream()** (new function):
   - Streams full files chunk-by-chunk
   - Requests each chunk with CRITICAL priority
   - Waits for chunks using event-based notification
   - No polling, no retries from client needed
   - Handles errors gracefully with proper error types

### Database-Driven Architecture
- Entry ID from database, not in-memory storage
- Total size from expected_total_size field
- Chunk availability from cache_chunks table
- NO file system checks, NO guessing

### Compilation
✅ Code compiles successfully with 0 errors
✅ All changes follow the design spec (CACHE_DESIGN.md)
✅ 10MB chunks as configured

### Next Steps
Task 326.06: Migrate state machine to be database-derived
Task 326.07: Add comprehensive integration tests
