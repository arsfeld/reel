## Description

The ConnectionMonitor worker was moved from src/platforms/relm4/components/workers/ to src/workers/ but needs to be properly integrated into the application's connection management system. This worker should monitor backend connection status and provide real-time updates to the UI.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Analyze ConnectionMonitor implementation and its intended purpose
- [ ] #2 Integrate ConnectionMonitor with the existing connection management in src/services/core/connection.rs
- [ ] #3 Connect ConnectionMonitor to UI components that need connection status updates
- [ ] #4 Implement proper error handling and reconnection logic
- [ ] #5 Add connection status indicators to the UI
- [ ] #6 Test connection monitoring with multiple backends (Plex, Jellyfin)
- [ ] #7 Ensure connection status updates are reflected in real-time
