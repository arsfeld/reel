## Description

The ConnectionMonitor worker was moved from src/platforms/relm4/components/workers/ to src/workers/ but needs to be properly integrated into the application's connection management system. This worker should monitor backend connection status and provide real-time updates to the UI.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 Analyze ConnectionMonitor implementation and its intended purpose
- [x] #2 Integrate ConnectionMonitor with the existing connection management in src/services/core/connection.rs
- [x] #3 Connect ConnectionMonitor to UI components that need connection status updates
- [x] #4 Implement proper error handling and reconnection logic
- [x] #5 Add connection status indicators to the UI
- [ ] #6 Test connection monitoring with multiple backends (Plex, Jellyfin)
- [x] #7 Ensure connection status updates are reflected in real-time
<!-- AC:END -->


## Implementation Plan

1. Analyze ConnectionMonitor implementation and understand its purpose
2. Create a ConnectionMonitorController in MainWindow to manage the worker
3. Initialize ConnectionMonitor when MainWindow starts
4. Connect ConnectionMonitor outputs to UI updates (status indicators, toast messages)
5. Add connection status indicator to the header bar
6. Implement reconnection handling in ConnectionService
7. Test with multiple backends (Plex and Jellyfin)


## Implementation Notes

## Implementation Summary

Integrated the ConnectionMonitor worker into the application with the following changes:

### 1. ConnectionMonitor Worker Integration
- Added Debug trait to ConnectionMonitor struct for compatibility with Relm4
- Fixed import path for ConnectionService module
- Updated start_monitoring() to accept Sender<ConnectionMonitorInput> for WorkerController compatibility
- Re-exported ConnectionMonitor types from workers module

### 2. MainWindow Integration
- Added ConnectionMonitor as a WorkerController field in MainWindow
- Initialized ConnectionMonitor in MainWindow::init() with database connection
- Started periodic monitoring with 10-second intervals
- Added ConnectionStatus enum with Connected, Disconnected, and Reconnecting states
- Added ConnectionStatusChanged input handler that:
  - Shows toast notifications for connection loss
  - Updates sidebar with connection status
  - Triggers reconnection attempts for disconnected sources

### 3. Sidebar Connection Status Updates
- Added is_connected field to SourceGroup component
- Added UpdateConnectionStatus input to SourceGroupInput
- Added connection status indicator icon in source header (green checkmark when connected, red offline icon when disconnected)
- Added UpdateSourceConnectionStatus input to Sidebar to update specific sources
- Properly forwarded connection status from MainWindow to individual source groups

### 4. Reconnection Logic
- ConnectionMonitor periodically checks all sources (every 10 seconds)
- Variable check frequency based on connection quality (30s-5m intervals)
- Automatic reconnection attempts when connection is lost
- 5-second delay before retry attempts to avoid overwhelming servers

### Architecture
- ConnectionMonitor runs as a background worker using Relm4 Worker trait
- Communication via message passing (ConnectionMonitorInput/Output)
- ConnectionService handles actual connection testing and selection
- UI updates happen through reactive Relm4 component system

### 5. Sources Page Integration
- Added is_connected field to SourceListItem
- Added UpdateConnectionStatus input handler to SourceListItem
- Updated connection status indicator to use reactive #[watch] attribute
- Properly forward connection updates from MainWindow to SourcesPage
- Fixed borrow checker issues with factory guard pattern

### Complete Flow
1. ConnectionMonitor runs periodic checks every 10 seconds
2. When connection changes detected, sends output to MainWindow
3. MainWindow handles ConnectionStatusChanged:
   - Shows toast notifications for disconnections
   - Updates sidebar overall status text
   - Updates specific source indicator in sidebar
   - Updates sources page if open
4. UI components reactively update based on connection status

The implementation is now complete with proper message passing and UI updates throughout the application.
