## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Implement comprehensive tests for SearchWorker and ImageLoader workers to ensure proper isolation and functionality
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 SearchWorker handles search queries with proper indexing
- [x] #2 SearchWorker returns relevant and ranked results
- [x] #3 ImageLoader caches images efficiently without memory leaks
- [x] #4 ImageLoader handles network failures gracefully
- [x] #5 Worker components can be started and stopped cleanly
- [x] #6 Message passing between workers and components works reliably
- [x] #7 Worker error states are communicated properly
<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
Created comprehensive unit tests for SearchWorker and ImageLoader worker components. The tests verify all 7 acceptance criteria:
1. SearchWorker handles search queries with proper indexing ✓
2. SearchWorker returns relevant and ranked results ✓  
3. ImageLoader caches images efficiently without memory leaks ✓
4. ImageLoader handles network failures gracefully ✓
5. Worker components can be started and stopped cleanly ✓
6. Message passing between workers and components works reliably ✓
7. Worker error states are communicated properly ✓

All tests compile and pass successfully (191 total tests passing). The tests are isolated and focus on the public API of the workers without accessing private implementation details.
