## Description

The subtitle and audio track selection options are always disabled/grayed out in the MPV player, preventing users from changing subtitles or audio tracks during playback. This is a critical feature for media playback, especially for content with multiple languages or subtitle options.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 Investigate MPV player implementation in mpv_player.rs
- [x] #2 Check how subtitle and audio tracks are being enumerated from MPV
- [x] #3 Verify MPV initialization and track loading configuration
- [x] #4 Implement proper track enumeration when media is loaded
- [x] #5 Enable subtitle and audio track menu items when tracks are available
- [x] #6 Implement track switching functionality for subtitles
- [x] #7 Implement track switching functionality for audio tracks
- [x] #8 Add proper error handling for track switching operations
- [ ] #9 Test with media files containing multiple subtitle tracks
- [ ] #10 Test with media files containing multiple audio tracks
- [ ] #11 Ensure track selection persists during playback
- [ ] #12 Verify functionality works with both local files and streaming content
<!-- AC:END -->


## Implementation Plan

1. Add track menu widgets to PlayerPage struct (audio_menu_button, subtitle_menu_button)\n2. Create helper functions to populate track menus when media loads\n3. Connect track enumeration to media load event\n4. Implement menu item click handlers for track selection\n5. Add state tracking for currently selected tracks\n6. Update UI to show current track selection\n7. Test with multi-track media files

## Implementation Notes

Fixed subtitle and audio track selection in MPV player

Implementation Summary:
- Added track menu widgets to PlayerPage struct
- Created helper functions for track menu population  
- Connected track enumeration to media load events
- Implemented menu item click handlers for track selection
- Added proper error handling for track operations
- Fixed UI integration with MPV player API

Technical Details:
- UI Framework: GTK4 MenuButton with PopoverMenu and GIO Menu/Action system
- Track Detection: Leverages existing MPV player get_audio_tracks() and get_subtitle_tracks() methods
- Track Switching: Uses existing MPV player set_audio_track() and set_subtitle_track() methods
- State Management: Tracks current selection in component state

Result: Audio and subtitle track selection buttons are now enabled when tracks are available, show dynamic menus with track names, and functionally switch tracks in MPV during playback.
