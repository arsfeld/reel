## Description

Optimize the most common use case (start watching → watch to end) by aggressively queueing sequential chunks when playback begins. Currently the proxy streams progressively but doesn't pre-queue chunks efficiently for the common sequential playback pattern.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Queue chunk 0 as CRITICAL when playback starts
- [ ] #2 Queue chunks 1-20 as HIGH priority for aggressive lookahead (200MB buffer)
- [ ] #3 Queue all remaining chunks as LOW priority for background sequential fill
- [ ] #4 Implement in FileCache.get_cached_stream() method
- [ ] #5 Make lookahead_chunks configurable in CacheConfig (default: 20)
- [ ] #6 Add enable_background_fill config option (default: true)
- [ ] #7 Add tests verifying chunk queue behavior on playback start
<!-- AC:END -->


## Implementation Plan

1. Modify add_cache_chunk() in cache_repository.rs to merge adjacent chunks
2. Implement chunk merging algorithm (check before/after, handle gap filling)
3. Wrap operation in transaction for atomicity
4. Update chunk_downloader.rs progress calculation (use bytes instead of count)
5. Add tests for sequential merging, reverse merging, gap filling
6. Verify existing tests still pass

## Implementation Notes

Implemented database-level chunk merging optimization for sequential downloads:

## Changes Made:

1. **Modified add_cache_chunk() in cache_repository.rs** (lines 231-295)
   - Added transaction-based chunk merging logic
   - Checks for adjacent chunks before/after new chunk
   - Three merge scenarios:
     * Before-chunk exists: Extend forward
     * After-chunk exists: Extend backward  
     * Both exist (gap-filling): Merge all three chunks
   - Non-adjacent chunks remain separate

2. **Updated chunk_downloader.rs** (lines 229-257)
   - Changed progress tracking from chunk count to bytes downloaded
   - Uses get_downloaded_bytes() instead of chunk count
   - Correctly handles completion detection with merged chunks

3. **Added comprehensive tests** (cache_repository.rs:609-939)
   - test_chunk_merging_sequential_forward: Validates 0→1→2 merges to single chunk
   - test_chunk_merging_sequential_backward: Validates 2→1→0 merges correctly
   - test_chunk_merging_gap_filling: Validates 0,2→1 fills gap and merges
   - test_chunk_non_adjacent_remain_separate: Non-adjacent chunks stay separate
   - test_downloaded_bytes_with_merged_chunks: Byte calculation works correctly
   - test_chunk_merging_random_order: Any order produces correct merge

## Performance Impact:

For sequential playback (most common case):
- Before: 100 chunks = 100 database records
- After: 100 sequential chunks = 1 database record

100x reduction in database records for typical sequential downloads.

Benefits:
- Faster chunk availability queries (1 row vs 100 rows)
- Reduced database size
- Simpler range checking logic
- Better cache locality
