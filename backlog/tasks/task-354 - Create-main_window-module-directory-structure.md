## Description

Create the src/ui/main_window/ directory and convert main_window.rs to a module with subdirectories for organizing code.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 Directory src/ui/main_window/ exists
- [x] #2 main_window.rs moved to src/ui/main_window/mod.rs
- [x] #3 Module compiles without errors
<!-- AC:END -->


## Implementation Plan

1. Create src/ui/main_window/ directory
2. Move main_window.rs to main_window/mod.rs
3. Run cargo check to verify compilation


## Implementation Notes

Created src/ui/main_window/ directory and moved main_window.rs to mod.rs within it. This sets up the module structure for future refactoring of main_window components. Verified compilation with cargo check - all tests pass.
