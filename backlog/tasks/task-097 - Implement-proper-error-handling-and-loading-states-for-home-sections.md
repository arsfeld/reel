## Description

The HomePage component needs robust error handling for backend failures and proper loading states to prevent broken UI when sections fail to load or are slow to respond.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Individual section failures don't break the entire home page
- [ ] #2 Loading spinners appear for each section while data is being fetched
- [ ] #3 Network errors show appropriate retry mechanisms
- [ ] #4 Backend authentication failures are handled gracefully
- [ ] #5 Empty or failed sections show informative messages to users
- [ ] #6 Loading states don't interfere with successful sections displaying
<!-- AC:END -->
