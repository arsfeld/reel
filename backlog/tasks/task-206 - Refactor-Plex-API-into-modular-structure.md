## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Split the monolithic src/backends/plex/api.rs file (currently 1490 lines) into multiple organized modules following Rust and Relm4 best practices. The file contains multiple functional areas including authentication, library management, media fetching, stream handling, progress tracking, home sections, and response type definitions that can be logically separated for better maintainability and easier extension with new endpoints.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 Large api.rs file is split into logical modules (client, library, media, streaming, progress, home, types)
- [x] #2 All public APIs remain unchanged to maintain backwards compatibility
- [x] #3 Module structure follows Rust naming conventions and best practices
- [x] #4 Import statements are properly organized and optimized
- [x] #5 Documentation is preserved and enhanced where needed
- [x] #6 All existing tests continue to pass without modification
- [x] #7 New module structure makes adding new Plex endpoints easier and more intuitive
<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Plan

<!-- SECTION:PLAN:BEGIN -->
1. Analyze current 1489-line api.rs file to identify logical groups
2. Create new module structure:
   - client.rs: PlexApi struct and core HTTP client setup
   - types.rs: All response types and data structures
   - auth.rs: Authentication and machine ID functions
   - library.rs: Library and media fetching (movies, shows, seasons, episodes)
   - streaming.rs: Stream URL and quality options
   - progress.rs: Progress tracking and watched status
   - home.rs: Home sections and recommendations
   - markers.rs: Chapter markers and intro/credits detection
3. Move code to appropriate modules while preserving all public APIs
4. Create mod.rs to re-export all public items
5. Update imports in backend.rs
6. Run tests to ensure backward compatibility
<!-- SECTION:PLAN:END -->

## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
Successfully refactored the monolithic 1489-line api.rs file into a well-organized module structure:

1. Created api/ subdirectory with 7 specialized modules:
   - types.rs: All Plex API response types and data structures (356 lines)
   - client.rs: PlexApi struct and core HTTP client functionality (75 lines)
   - library.rs: Library and media fetching (movies, shows, seasons, episodes) (249 lines)
   - streaming.rs: Stream URL generation and quality options (99 lines)
   - progress.rs: Playback progress tracking and watched status (120 lines)
   - home.rs: Home sections and hub management (495 lines)
   - markers.rs: Chapter markers for intros/credits (86 lines)
   - mod.rs: Module organization and re-exports (11 lines)

2. Maintained backward compatibility - all public APIs remain unchanged
3. Fixed type mismatches and added missing fields to support existing tests
4. All 12 Plex backend tests pass without modification
5. Improved code organization makes it easier to add new endpoints

The refactor reduces cognitive load, improves maintainability, and creates clear boundaries between different functional areas of the Plex API integration.
