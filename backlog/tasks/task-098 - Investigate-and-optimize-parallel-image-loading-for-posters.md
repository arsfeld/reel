## Description

Investigate whether image posters are being loaded in parallel and optimize the concurrent loading mechanism if needed. The current implementation has a max_concurrent_loads limit of 6, but it's unclear if loads are truly happening in parallel or if there are bottlenecks preventing optimal throughput.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Analyze current image loading implementation for parallelism
- [ ] #2 Profile network requests to verify concurrent loading behavior
- [ ] #3 Identify any bottlenecks in the loading pipeline
- [ ] #4 Optimize parallel loading if improvements are found
- [ ] #5 Test with large libraries to verify performance gains
