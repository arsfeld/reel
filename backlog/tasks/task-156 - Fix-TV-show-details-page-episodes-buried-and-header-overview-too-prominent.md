## Description

Episodes are currently buried at the bottom of the TV show details page and are barely visible. The header is too large and the overview section has too many visual effects (glassy appearance) that distract from the main content. Need to restructure the layout to prioritize episode visibility.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Episodes section is prominently displayed and easily accessible (not buried at bottom)
- [ ] #2 TV show header is reduced in size to be more proportional
- [ ] #3 Overview section is redesigned to be smaller and more subtle (remove glassy effects)
- [ ] #4 Overview is relocated to a less prominent position in the layout
- [ ] #5 Visual hierarchy prioritizes content (episodes) over decorative elements
<!-- AC:END -->
