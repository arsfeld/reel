## Description

Research and document additional error scenarios that may occur in the cache system beyond the identified ones. Consider edge cases, race conditions, and platform-specific issues.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Document concurrent access scenarios (read while write, delete while read)
- [ ] #2 Research file system-specific issues (NTFS, ext4, APFS)
- [ ] #3 Identify race conditions in cache operations
- [ ] #4 Document HTTP/network edge cases (partial responses, redirects)
- [ ] #5 Consider multi-process cache access scenarios
- [ ] #6 Create test cases for documented scenarios
