## Description

The sidebar needs to show active sync status both at the library level (with spinner indicators) and in the existing status area below the sidebar that currently shows 'No sources connected'. This will give users clear visibility of sync operations happening for each library and overall sync status.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 Spinner indicator appears next to each library name when that library is syncing
- [x] #2 Spinner disappears when library sync completes
- [x] #3 Status text below sidebar shows overall sync status instead of just 'No sources connected'
- [x] #4 Status text shows messages like 'Syncing Plex...', 'Sync complete', 'Sync failed', etc.
- [x] #5 Multiple concurrent sync operations are properly reflected in status text
- [ ] #6 Status area properly updates when sources connect/disconnect
<!-- AC:END -->


## Implementation Plan

1. Examine the current sidebar implementation to understand library list rendering and status area
2. Check how sync events are currently handled in the event system
3. Add spinner widget support to library items in sidebar
4. Connect sync events to update spinner visibility for each library
5. Update status text area to show detailed sync status messages
6. Test with multiple concurrent sync operations


## Implementation Notes

Implemented library-specific sync status display:

1. Added new broker message types for library sync events (LibrarySyncStarted, LibrarySyncCompleted)
2. Updated sync service to emit library-specific sync notifications when syncing each library
3. Enhanced SourceGroup component to track and display spinners for syncing libraries
4. Updated sidebar to track multiple concurrent sync operations (sources and libraries)
5. Implemented dynamic status text that shows what is currently syncing
6. Status messages update properly for sync start, progress, completion, and errors

The implementation successfully shows spinners next to libraries when they sync and displays detailed sync status in the sidebar status area. However, there is still an issue where the status shows "No sources configured" even when sources are connected - this needs to be addressed in a separate task.
